8.26 Store Maintenance Guide 
5/22/2023 
 
Exterior  
The “curb appeal” of every location day and night is extremely important.  All locations should be clean, and all 
lighting should be in full working order at all times.  
Windows 
The exterior side of the showroom windows should be cleaned once a month at every location and the 
interior side of the windows twice a year. please use the check list that can be found here  
(R:\8 About Store Procedures\2.0 General Store Procedure\8.25 Windows Check List). 
If the window cleaning service did not cover all items on the check list or you are not satisfied with their job, 
please share with them what you would like them to do in a polite way.  The company will not get paid if you 
do not sign off.  Your store’s team is responsible for the quality of the job performed.   
Roof Leaks 
It is important to address roof leaks immediately. If roof leaks are allowed to persist, they can cause 
extensive damage and attract pests.  For minor leaks please submit a Maintenance Request.  
If water is leaking uncontrollably, the situation is a risk to safety, call first, then send a regular email to a 
member of the Sales Leadership team (no email template is required for emergency situations).  We will 
address the concern immediately after receiving your call, however we also need to keep a digital record of 
each emergency and non- emergency repair request (email). 
Lighting 
Most store lighting is controlled by timers. For the outline of how to use the timers and when to set the 
lights to go on and off review. (R:\8 About Store Procedures \3.19 Exterior Lighting Procedure). 
Building Sign Letters 
Please submit a Maintenance Request for any letters that need to be repaired.   
Pylon Sign 
Please submit a Maintenance Request for any pylon repairs.  (R:\14 Templates, Forms and 
Reference\EmailTemplates\Maintenance Request) 
Parking Lot Lights 
Some locations have parking lot lights.  It is expected that all parking lot lights be in good working order at 
all 
times for safety and to prevent vandalism.  If a bulb needs to be replaced, please submit a Maintenance 
Request.  All parking lot light lights should be set and synchronized to the exterior signs.  (R:\8 About 
Store Procedures\3.0 Store Management\3.19 Exterior Lighting Procedure). 
Landscaping and Curb Appeal 
Leaders uses a single company statewide and you no longer need to provide a sign-off for each visit.  Lawns should 
be consistently mowed, parking lots, garden beds and sidewalks should all be weed-free, and all shrubs should be 
trimmed. 
If the lawn service did not cover all items on the checklist or you are not satisfied with their job, please report your 
concern to Tim Newton at timnewton@leadersfurniture.com.  Your store’s team is responsible for the quality of 
the job performed.
