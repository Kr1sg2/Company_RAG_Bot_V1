Sprinklers 
Some locations have sprinklers.  Sprinkler timers must be set properly, and systems must be checked periodically for 
proper operation.  If your system needs repair, first, check with your lawn company to see if they work on sprinkler 
systems.  If you have concerns with your sprinklers please report them to your territory leader.   
Monthly maintenance check lists 
Vendors are contracted to help maintain your showroom.  A check list should be filled out each time a contractor 
visits and the check list should be forwarded to Accounts Payable each month.   
Please do not sign off on incomplete or inferior work.  You have the right to ask the contractor to correct the 
concern.   
Accounts Payable:  a-p@leadersfurniture.com.
