9.6 Community Matters Procedure 
12/6/2023 
How Funds Are Generated and Used 
Each retail location will accrue 5% of all delivery fees collected, to use toward donation and sponsorship requests. 
For example, for every $100 in In-Home Delivery Fees invoiced, you earn $5 for your showroom to use for Donations and 
sponsorships. 
How Much Has My Team Accrued To Give Back? 
You can see how much your team has accrued over a given time period by accessing the Advertising | Delivery Income 
by Location search in NetSuite.  This search will show you how much has been earned.  It will not tell you how much has 
already been used. 
1. Type “Advertising | Delivery Income by Location” in the global search at the top of your NetSuite screen. 
2. Set the date range you would like to search 
3. Mulitply the total x .05 to calculate how much your team accrued to give back over the time period.   
 
✓ Funds will be added to the balance at the beginning of each quarter, based on the In-Home Delivery Fees from 
the prior quarter. 
✓ For Community Bank balance inquiries, contact Kimberly Sullivan (Kimberly.Sullivan@leadersfurniture.com). 
✓ Funds not used by the end of the year will not roll over.  January 1st of the new year your store balance will start 
back at $0. 
✓ Showrooms are welcome to team up and spread the funds over multiple areas for a “shared experience”.  For 
example, if you are near another showroom and both would like to participate, both showrooms can split the 
donation.
