7.5 Do You Know About Aluminum 
11/28/2017 
 
Do you know about Aluminum? 
Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust and is the 3rd most abundant element on 
Earth after oxygen and silicon, making up about 8% by weight of the Earth’s solid surface. Its remarkable 
ability to resist corrosion and its low density make it a perfect material in the manufacturing of outdoor 
furniture.   
Is Aluminum Valuable?  
Although Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth’s crust, it is 
rare in its free form, and was once considered a precious metal more valuable than 
gold. The Washington monument was completed with an aluminum capstone in 
1884, which was the largest single piece of cast aluminum at the time and was 
chosen because it was more expensive than silver, gold or platinum. Napoleon III, 
the emperor of France, once gave a banquet where the most honored guests were 
given aluminum utensils, while the others had to make do with gold. While aluminum is still a valued 
material due to its wide use in many industries, it has been produced in commercial quantities for just 
over 100 years, no longer making it the precious metal that it once was.   
What is Special about Aluminum?  
Aluminum has a variety of special characteristics that make it 
a widely used material in many industries and a perfect 
material for outdoor furniture making.    
 
It is durable and lightweight, making it easy to 
manage and transport.  
 
Aluminum is approximately one-third the density and 
stiffness of steel; making it soft enough to bend, 
machine, cast and weld into desired shapes when 
heated.  Once cooled Aluminum becomes more rigid and strong enough to bear weight without 
breaking. 
 
Aluminum’s remarkable ability to resist corrosion is due to a thin surface layer of aluminum 
oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. This 
corrosion resistance means that it will not rust and will maintain its structural integrity for years 
in tough outdoor environments.  
 
Aluminum is a non-ferrous metal, meaning that it contains no iron and is not magnetic and will 
not spark.
