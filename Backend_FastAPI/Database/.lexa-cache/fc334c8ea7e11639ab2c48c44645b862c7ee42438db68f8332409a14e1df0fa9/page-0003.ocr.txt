Welcome 
 
Welcome new Team Member! 
 
On behalf of your colleagues, I welcome you to Leaders Holding Co™, as known throughout the 
handbook as “the company” and wish you every success here. 
 
We believe that each Team Member contributes directly to our growth and success, and we hope 
you will take pride in being a member of our team. 
 
This handbook was developed to describe some of the expectations of our Team Members and 
to outline the policies, programs, and benefits available to eligible Team Members.  Team 
Members should familiarize themselves with the contents of the Team Member handbook as 
soon as possible, for it will answer many questions about employment with our company. 
 
The company reserves the right to alter, amend, or modify these policies with or without prior 
notice.  No statement by management may be interpreted as a change in policy, nor will it 
constitute an agreement with an Team Member. 
 
We hope that your experience here will be challenging, enjoyable, and rewarding. Again, 
welcome! 
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Tim Newton, President 
LEADERS HOLDING CO™
