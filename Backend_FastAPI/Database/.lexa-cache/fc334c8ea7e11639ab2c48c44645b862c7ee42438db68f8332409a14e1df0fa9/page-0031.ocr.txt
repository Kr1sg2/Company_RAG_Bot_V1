â€¢ 
The Company may disclose information to the Team Member or to the decision-maker in 
a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual. This 
may include worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding 
relating to a benefit sought by the Team Member. 
If a Team Member attempts but fails to provide an adequate amount of breath the Company will 
be immediately notified and will direct the Team Member to obtain, as soon as practical, an 
evaluation from a licensed physician who is acceptable to the Company concerning the Team 
Member's medical ability to provide an adequate amount of breath. If the physician determines 
that there is a medical reason that prevents the Team Member from providing an adequate 
amount of breath, he/she will provide the Company with a written statement of the basis for his 
or her conclusion. If the physician determines there is no medical reason to prevent the Team 
Member from providing and adequate amount of breath, he/she will provide the Company with 
a written statement of the basis for his or her conclusion and it will be regarded as a refusal to 
take the test. The terms of this policy will then be administered. 
 
B. Drug Testing Procedures: 
Specific guidelines will be followed in urine specimen collections for the purpose of drug testing. 
In accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines a clear and 
well documented procedure for collection, shipment, and accession of urine specimens from the 
Company to the laboratory. Procedures will account for the integrity of each urine specimen by 
tracking its handling and storage from point of specimen collection to final disposition of the 
specimen. 
Drug tests will be conducted at Concentra Care, Baycare Urgent Care, LabCorp or Quest 
Diagnostics. These facilities meet security requirements as specified by DHHS guidelines. The 
collection site will be a secure location to allow for maximum privacy, which includes a toilet for 
completion of urination, a source of water for washing hands and, where practicable, excluded 
from the area provided for urination. No other person will be present or gain access to the 
collection area during the collection process. All specimens must remain in the direct control of 
the collection site person. No one other than the collection site person may handle specimens 
prior to their being placed securely in the mailing container. When reporting to a collection site 
for specimen collection each Team Member will be required to provide a photo I.D. Team 
Members will be asked to remove all unnecessary outer garments (i.e., coat or jacket), and secure 
all personal belongings (individual may retain his/her wallet). 
Team Members will be allowed to provide his/her specimen in the privacy of a stall under strict 
supervision. A split sample method of collection will be used. At least 45 ml of urine must be 
collected, 30 ml to be used as the primary specimen and 15 ml to be used as the split specimen. 
Both bottles will be shipped in a single container. 
If the collection site person believes tampering or adulteration has occurred, a second specimen 
shall be collected immediately under the direct observation of a same gender collection site 
person. Both samples will be sent to the lab. Refusal to test will be handled the same as a verified 
positive result. In all cases the Team Member and the collection site person shall always keep the 
specimen in view prior to being sealed and labeled. The specimen will be labeled with 
tamperproof seals and the Team Member will sign appropriate places on the Chain of Custody 
and initial the seal on the bottle attesting to the fact that the specimen is specific to the individual 
providing the sample.
