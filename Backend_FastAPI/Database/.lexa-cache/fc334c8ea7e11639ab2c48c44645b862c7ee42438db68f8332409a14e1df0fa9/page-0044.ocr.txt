OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Customer Relations 
Customers are among Leaders Holding Co™ most valuable assets. Every Team Member represents 
Leaders Holding Co™ to our customers and the public. Customers judge all of us by how they are 
treated with each Team Member contact. Therefore, one of our first business priorities is to assist 
any customer or potential customer. Nothing is more important than being courteous, friendly, 
helpful, and prompt in the attention you give to customers. 
 
Leaders Holding Co™ will provide customer relations and services training to all Team Members 
with extensive customer contact. Customers who wish to lodge specific comments or complaints 
should be directed to Customer Service for appropriate action. Our personal contact with the 
public, our manners on the telephone, and the communications we send to customers are a 
reflection not only of ourselves, but also of the professionalism of Leaders Holding Co™. Positive 
customer relations not only enhance the public's perception or image of Leaders Holding Co™, 
but also pay off in greater customer loyalty and increased sales and profit. 
Emergency Closings 
At times, emergencies such as severe weather can disrupt company operations. In extreme cases, 
these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. In the event that such an 
emergency occurs during nonworking hours, Team Members will be notified of such a closing via 
telephone or email. 
 
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled 
work will be unpaid. However, with supervisory approval, Team Members may use available paid 
leave time, such as unused PTO benefits.  
 
In cases where an emergency does not require the office or store to be closed, Team Members 
who fail to report for work will not be paid for the time off.  
 
Team Members in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are 
officially closed. In these circumstances, Team Members who work will receive regular pay. 
Team Member Parking 
The company provides Team Members with parking; however, some parking areas may be 
reserved for disabled drivers, vendors, clients, vehicles belonging to the company, and others. 
The parking lot for all Team Members is in the parking lot adjacent to the building.  Leaders 
Holding Co™ will not be responsible for any damage to your vehicle or the contents of your vehicle 
while parked on company property. 
Business Travel and Expenses 
Leaders Holding Co™ will reimburse Team Members for reasonable business travel expenses 
incurred while on assignments away from the normal work location.  All business travel must be 
approved in advance by the President at Leaders Holding Co™.
