Team Members are the most highly paid 10% of Team Members within a 75-mile radius of a 
covered worksite.  The Company will notify Team Members if FMLA leave is denied on this basis. 
 
Staying in touch while on leave. 
 Team Members who take leave because of their own serious health condition or to care for a 
covered relation must contact Human Resources on a weekly basis regarding the status of the 
need for leave and intention to return to work.  Team Members who unequivocally indicate that 
they do not intend to return to work while protected by the FMLA may no longer be considered 
on FMLA leave. 
 
Requesting additional leave   
Team Members who need to extend FMLA leave beyond what was originally granted must contact 
Human Resources as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of the need for additional leave 
personally or if that is not possible, through their representatives.  The Company may request 
appropriate substantiation (such as medical certification if applicable) of the need for additional 
leave in reviewing requests.  If a request is granted, the Company will notify the Team Member 
of the new terms of leave.  The Company may, but is not required to, grant leave beyond that 
required by the FMLA.  Any leave beyond that required by the FMLA will not be subject to the 
protections of the FMLA. 
 
Returning to work   
Team Members wishing to return to work from FMLA leave must give notice to Human Resources 
as soon as practicable (a return-to-work date may be agreed upon at any point during FMLA 
leave).  If a date is not previously agreed, the Company generally requires at least two business 
days’ notice to restore a Team Member to work from FMLA leave. 
 
* Note: Team Members who are not eligible for FMLA (who may take unpaid approved leave) who 
are enrolled in Health insurance will be offered Team Member paid COBRA while on leave. 
Leave of Absence (NON-FMLA) 
Leaders Holding Co™ provides leaves of absence without pay to Team Members who need to take 
time off from work duties to fulfill personal obligations. Team Members may request a leave of 
absence only after the completion of one year of service.  As soon as eligible Team Members 
become aware of the need for a leave of absence, they should request a leave from their 
supervisor.  
 
Personal leave or medical leave (not covered under FMLA) may be granted for a period of up to 
30 days every rolling calendar year.  A Team Member will be required to use any available PTO 
time at the beginning of this leave.    
 
Requests for leave will be evaluated based on several factors, including anticipated workload 
requirements and staffing considerations during the proposed period of absence.  Subject to the 
terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, Team Members will become responsible 
for the full costs of health insurance benefits if they wish coverage to continue during periods of 
leave.  When the Team Member returns from leave, benefits will again be provided in accordance 
with the applicable plan provisions.
