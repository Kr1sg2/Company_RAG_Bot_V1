Paid Time Off (PTO)  
Leaders Holding Co™ believes that Team Members should have opportunities to enjoy time away 
from work to help balance their lives. The benefits of PTO are that it promotes a flexible approach 
to time off. Team Members are accountable and responsible for managing their own PTO hours 
to allow for adequate reserves if there is a need to cover vacation, illness or disability, 
appointments, emergencies, company closures due to natural disasters and other unexpected 
events, or any other situations that may require time off from work.  The company has established 
this paid time off (PTO) policy to meet those needs.  
 
Only full-time personnel are eligible for PTO and PTO redemption.  PTO is awarded on the Team 
Member’s anniversary date as follows: 
 
Less than 90-Days 
 
0 Days 
Following 90-Days

Following 1 Year 
 
12 Days 
Following 2 Years

PTO is to be arranged to be mutually convenient for the Team Member and the company.  PTO 
requests must be submitted through the timekeeping system at least one (1) week in advance of 
your first approved PTO day.  PTO requests will be reviewed, approved, or denied based on several 
factors including staffing requirements and business needs. PTO periods are granted considering 
operating requirements of the company and previously acknowledged PTO requests.  PTO priority 
is determined on a first come first served basis not considering seniority. If you are a part time 
Team Member or do not have any available PTO, please request unpaid time off through the 
timekeeping system to document your approved time away from work. 
 
A Team Member may only take a PTO day for the day(s) they are not working their scheduled 
day(s).  Five (5) awarded PTO days are allowed to be used toward unscheduled PTO.  Unscheduled 
PTO is time off without prior approval from your supervisor or manager including sick and 
personal days.  Non-exempt Team Members having unscheduled absences beyond five (5) days 
are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.    
 
A Team Member may roll over up to 40 hours of unused PTO from the previous anniversary year.  
 
Team Members who resign will be eligible to receive a payout of their remaining PTO balance if 
they have given a two (2) week notice and a three (3) week notice for managers.  Resigning 
Team Members may not take any PTO during the notice period.  The Team Member must fulfill 
all duties of their position in a satisfactory manner for the entire notice period to be eligible for 
the PTO payout.  The payout will occur after the last day of work on the next scheduled 
paycheck.
