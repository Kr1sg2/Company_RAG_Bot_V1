All new and rehired Team Members work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days 
after their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend the introductory period 
by the length of the absence.  
 
During the introductory period, new Team Members are eligible for those benefits that are 
required by law, such as workers' compensation insurance and Social Security. After the 
introductory period is completed, Team Members may also be eligible for other company 
provided benefits, subject to the terms and conditions of each benefits program. Team Members 
should read the information for each specific benefits program for the details on eligibility 
requirements. 
Personnel Data Changes 
It is the responsibility of each Team Member to promptly notify Leaders Holding Co™ of any 
changes in personal information. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and 
names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational 
accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any 
personal information has changed, notify Human Resources.  
Timekeeping 
Federal and state laws require Leaders Holding Co™ to keep an accurate record of time worked 
to calculate Team Member pay and benefits. Time worked is all the time spent on the job 
performing assigned duties. Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every 
nonexempt Team Member. Nonexempt Team Members should accurately record the time they 
begin and end their work, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period.  They 
should also record the beginning and ending time of any split shift or departure from work for 
personal reasons.  Overtime work must always be approved before it is performed. 
 
Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording time on another Team Member's 
time record is a direct violation of this policy.  
 
Nonexempt Team Members should report to work no more than 5 minutes prior to their 
scheduled starting time nor stay more than 5 minutes after their scheduled stop time without 
expressed, prior authorization from their supervisor.  
 
It is the responsibility of all non-exempt Team Members to review their time records weekly.  
Notify your manager or Human Resources immediately if your time record is not accurate.  Please 
bring any discrepancies in your paycheck to the attention of Human Resources.  When the 
discrepancy is verified, the adjustment will be reflected on your next check. 
Paydays 
All Team Members are paid on a Bi-weekly basis.  Each paycheck will include earnings for all work 
performed through the end of the previous payroll period. Our weekly pay period begins on a 
Monday and ends on a Sunday.  We have a paperless payroll system, and you will be required to 
supply direct deposit information.  You will be able to access your payroll information online.
