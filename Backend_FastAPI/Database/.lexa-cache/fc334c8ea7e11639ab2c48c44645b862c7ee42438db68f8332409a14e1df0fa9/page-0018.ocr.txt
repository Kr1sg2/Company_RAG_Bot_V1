• 
Family members of veterans for up to five years after a veteran leaves service if he or she 
develops a service-related injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated while on active 
duty. 
 
The single 12-month period begins on the first day the Team Member takes leave for this reason 
and ends 12 months later, regardless of the 12-month period applicable to any other leave under 
the FMLA.  An eligible Team Member is limited to a combined total of 26 work weeks of leave 
under the FMLA during the single 12-month period (not more than 12 of the 26 weeks total may 
be for an FMLA-qualifying reason other than to care for a covered service member). 
 
If two Team Members who are married to each-other work for the Company, the aggregate 
amount of leave that can be taken by both under the FMLA for the birth of a child or placement 
for adoption or foster care of a child, or to care for parents with a serious health condition, under 
the FMLA is 12 weeks within a 12-month period.  Note, as the FMLA is a federal law and federal 
law does recognize marriages between persons of the same sex. 
 
General Provisions 
The provisions below are applicable to both family/medical and military family leave under the 
FMLA. 
 
Measurement method 
Except in the case of Military Caregiver Leave, an eligible Team Member’s FMLA leave entitlement 
is limited to a total of 12 work weeks of leave during any 12-month period as measured on a 
rolling basis, measuring backward from the date the Team Member uses any FMLA leave other 
than Military Caregiver leave.  The single 12-month period applicable to Military Caregiver leave 
is measured forward from the date the Team Member’s first leave to care for the covered service 
member 
begins.  
 
Intermittent leave 
An eligible Team Member may take leave under the FMLA intermittently (including working a 
reduced schedule) when medically necessary with respect to qualifying leave for the condition of 
the Team Member, the Team Member’s spouse, the Team Member’s child, or for the care of a 
covered service member.  Intermittent leave is also available for Qualifying Exigency leave.  Team 
Members are expected make reasonable efforts to schedule planned medical treatment so as not 
to unduly disrupt the employer’s operations if possible.  If intermittent leave is unpaid, the 
Company reserves the right to reduce the Team Member’s salary based on the amount of time 
actually worked, regardless of whether the Team Member is salaried/exempt. In addition, while 
a Team Member is on an intermittent leave, the Company may temporarily transfer the Team 
Member to an available alternative position that better accommodates the recurring leave and 
that has equivalent pay and benefits. 
A Team Member may request intermittent leave to care for the Team Member’s own child during 
the first year following birth, or to care for a child placed with the Team Member for foster care 
or adoption.  Unless the leave is due to the child’s serious health condition, the Company may 
decline to grant such leave on an intermittent basis and instead require that it be taken on a 
continuous basis.
