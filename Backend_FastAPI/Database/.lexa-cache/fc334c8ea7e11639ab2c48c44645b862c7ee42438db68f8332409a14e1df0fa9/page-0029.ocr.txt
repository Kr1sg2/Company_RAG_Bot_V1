responsibility to notify the Company immediately to ensure actions are taken to meet the testing 
requirements.  If the test for controlled substances or alcohol is positive, the Team Member will 
be immediately terminated and not eligible for reemployment for two years.   
  
Note: Nothing in this requirement should be construed as to require the delay of necessary 
medical attention for injured people following an accident. 
 
C. Random Testing: 
• 
All Team Members of the Company in safety-sensitive positions will be subject to random 
testing for alcohol and controlled substances. Random testing will be done on a percentage 
basis in a fair and equal manner. 
• 
For alcohol testing a Team Member shall only be tested while the Team Member is performing 
safety-sensitive functions, immediately prior to performing, or immediately after performing 
safety-sensitive functions. For drug testing a Team Member may be tested at any time the 
Team Member is at work for the Company. Selection of Team Members for random testing 
will be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-
based random number generator that is matched with drivers' Social Security numbers, 
payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. 
• 
Each time a random selection is made, every Team Member will have an equal chance of 
being selected. Random tests will be unannounced and spread reasonably throughout the 
year. Team Members, when notified that they have been selected for random testing will 
proceed immediately to the collection site. 
 
D. Reasonable Suspicion Testing: 
Any Team Member while on Company property, or while engaging in Company business, acts in 
an abnormal manner sufficient to cause reasonable suspicion that he/she has violated this policy, 
he/she will be required to submit to an alcohol and/or a controlled substance test upon the 
approval and direction of an officer of the Company. 
 
E. Return-to-duty Testing: 
The Team Member is allowed to return-to-duty following referral, evaluation, and treatment 
because of a positive alcohol or drug test will be required to submit to a return-to-duty alcohol 
and/or controlled substance test. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 and a negative drug 
test will be required before a return-to-duty decision is made. 
 
F. Follow-up Testing: 
In the event a Team Member is allowed to return-to-duty following referral, evaluation, and 
treatment, a minimum of 6 unannounced alcohol and/or drug tests will be required during the 
next 12 months of employment. Follow-up testing may continue for up to 60 months following 
return-to-duty at the Company's discretion, based on recommendations from the Substance 
Abuse Professional. 
 
All alcohol testing will be done immediately before, during, or immediately after performing 
safety sensitive functions. Controlled substance testing may be performed at any time the Team 
Member is at work for the Company.
