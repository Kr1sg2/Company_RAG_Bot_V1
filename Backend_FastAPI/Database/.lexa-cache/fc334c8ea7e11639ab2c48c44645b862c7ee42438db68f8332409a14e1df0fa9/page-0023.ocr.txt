and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA1). Advance notice of military service is required, unless 
military necessity prevents such notice, or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable. 
 
The leave will be unpaid. However, Team Members may use any available paid time off for the 
absence.  
 
Continuation of health insurance benefits is available as required by USERRA based on the length 
of the leave and subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans for which 
the Team Member is otherwise eligible.  
 
Benefit accruals, such as PTO, a leave of absence, or holiday benefits, will be suspended during 
the leave and will resume upon the Team Member's return to active employment. 
 
Team Members on military leave for up to 30 days are required to return to work for the first 
regularly scheduled shift after the end of service, allowing reasonable travel time. Team Members 
on longer military leave must apply for reinstatement in accordance with USERRA and all 
applicable state laws. 
 
Team Members returning from military leave will be placed in the position they would have 
attained had they remained continuously employed or a comparable one depending on the length 
of military service in accordance with USERRA. They will be treated as though they were 
continuously employed for the purpose of determining benefits based on length of service.
