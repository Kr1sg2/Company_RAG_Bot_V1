401(k) Retirement Plan 
Leaders Holding Co™ has established a 401(k) Retirement Plan to provide Team Members the 
potential for future financial security for retirement. 
 
All Team Members are eligible for the 401(k) plan and will be auto enrolled at 3%. The first 
contribution to the plan will be the first payroll of the month following 60 days of consecutive 
service.   
 
You may elect the percentage of your salary to contribute based on your retirement planning 
goals. New Team Members will be auto enrolled at 3%.  You may make changes to your 
contribution percentage on the provider website as often as once per month. Leaders Holding 
Co™ may also contribute an additional matching amount to each Team Member's 401(k) 
contribution on an annual basis.  You must be employed on the last day of the calendar year to 
receive any matching contributions.  
 
Complete details of the 401(k) Retirement Plan are described in the Summary Plan Description 
found on the provider website. Links to benefits providers can be found in your Netsuite Employee 
Center. Contact Human Resources for more information about the 401(k) plan. 
EAP 
Leaders Holding Co™ cares about the health and well-being of its Team Members and recognizes 
that a variety of personal problems can disrupt their personal and work lives.  While many Team 
Members solve their problems either on their own or with the help of family and friends, 
sometimes Team Members need professional assistance and advice. 
 
Through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), the Human Resources office can assist you in 
finding counseling services available in the area to help you deal with personal problems such as 
alcohol and other substance abuse, marital and family difficulties, financial or legal troubles, and 
emotional distress.   
 
The EAP is strictly confidential and is designed to safeguard your privacy and rights. Information 
given to the EAP counselor may be released only if requested by you in writing.  A Professional 
Code of Ethics guides all counselors. 
 
Personal information concerning Team Member participation in the EAP is maintained in a 
confidential manner.  No information related to a Team Member's participation in the program is 
entered into the personnel file. 
 
If you currently carry health plan; you may be eligible for counseling and only be required to pay 
a copay if the counselor is in network (depending on your health plan).    If further counseling is 
necessary, the EAP counselor will outline community and private services available.  The counselor 
will also let Team Members know whether any costs associated with private services may be 
covered by their health plan.  Costs that are not covered are the responsibility of the Team 
Member.
