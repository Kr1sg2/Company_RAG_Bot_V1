Pay, Benefits, and Protections During FMLA Leave 
Leave is unpaid. Family medical leave is unpaid leave, although Team Members on FMLA leave 
will receive any compensation they have earned that is payable while on leave. Team Members 
must use available PTO time to run concurrent while on Family Medical Leave.  The substitution 
of paid leave for unpaid leave does not extend the FMLA period. Furthermore, the substitution of 
paid leave for unpaid leave cannot result in the receipt of more than 100 percent of a Team 
Member’s salary.  
 
Medical benefits  
During an approved leave under the FMLA, the Company will maintain the Team Member’s health 
benefits, if any; as if the Team Member continued to be actively employed (this section does not 
apply if the Team Member does not participate in a Company-sponsored group health benefit).  
Both the Team Member and the Company will continue to be responsible for their respective 
shares of premium on the same terms as if the Team Member were actively at work (if paid time 
is substituted, regular payroll deductions will be made for health coverage from applicable pay).  
Because Team Members remain eligible for health group benefits, taking FMLA leave does not 
constitute a COBRA-qualifying event, however, if a Team Member does not return to work at the 
end of FMLA leave COBRA continuation may apply.  The Team Member will continue to pay the 
Team Member portion of the premium or make payment arrangements while on FMLA leave to 
pay their portion of the medical insurance. If the Team Member does not return to work at the 
end of FMLA leave the Company may recover from the Team Member any premium paid by it for 
the Team Member during FMLA leave. 
 
Other benefits  
Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the 
start of the Team Member’s leave.  
 
Reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave 
Upon return from FMLA leave, eligible Team Members must be restored to their original or 
equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.  However, Team 
Members are subject to no greater right to employment than if they had not taken leave.  Also, if 
a Team Member does not return to work within the time prescribed by the FMLA, the Team 
Member has no right to reinstatement. 
Other legally protected leave.  In some cases, leave under the FMLA will also be subject to other 
laws that provide legally protected leave.  This will often depend on applicable state law and will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Where types of legally protected leave are permitted to 
be used simultaneously the presumption will be that they are being used simultaneously unless 
the Company confirms otherwise in writing.
