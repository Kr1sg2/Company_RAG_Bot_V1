A. Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT): 
Alcohol testing will only be performed by a certified Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) trained and 
certified in the principles of Evidential Breath Testing Devices (EBT) methodology, operation, and 
calibration checks; the fundamentals of breath analysis for alcohol content; and the procedures 
required for obtaining a breath sample and interpreting and recording EBT results. 
 
Evidential Breath Testing Devices (EBT): 
Alcohol testing will only be performed using evidential breath testing devices (EBT's) approved by 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 
Alcohol testing must be either performed by a Certified BAT employed by the Company or an 
outside BAT. All alcohol testing will be conducted in a location that affords visual and aural privacy 
to the individual being tested. Unauthorized persons will not be permitted access to the testing 
location when a test is in progress. 
Alcohol testing will be performed using only the U.S. Department of Transportation Breath 
Alcohol Testing Form. 
 
ALCOHOL TESTING PROCEDURES: 
Using the Evidential Breath Testing Device, the certified Breath Alcohol Technician will open an 
individually sealed mouthpiece and attach it to the EBT. The Team Member will be instructed to 
blow into the mouthpiece forcefully until an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The 
EBT will record the result and display it on the device and print the result immediately. The result 
will be recorded on the Breath Testing Form and attached to the form with tamper proof tape. 
When the result is less than 0.02, no further testing is authorized, and the result will be 
transmitted to the Company in a confidential manner and will be stored to ensure confidentiality 
is maintained. 
When the result is 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test must be performed to verify the initial test. 
The confirmation test will be conducted no less than 15 minutes and no more than 20 minutes 
after the initial test. In the event the initial and confirmation test results are different, the 
confirmation test result is deemed to be the result upon which any action under the terms of this 
policy shall be based. 
Following the completion of the test, the BAT will date the form and sign the certification on the 
form. The Team Member will sign the certification and fill in the date on the form. This ensures 
that each Team Member is attesting to the fact that the reported result is specific to the Team 
Member. 
Refusal to test will be treated the same as if the result is 0.04 or greater. 
Leaders Holding Co™ will maintain alcohol and drug test results in a secure and confidential 
manner, so that disclosure of information to unauthorized persons does not occur. Team Member 
information shall only be released as required by law or as expressly authorized. 
• 
A Team Member shall have access to any of his/her alcohol and drug testing records upon 
written request. 
• 
The Company must allow any DOT authorized agency access to facilities and records in 
connection with the Company's alcohol misuse and drug abuse prevention program. 
• 
When requested, the Company shall disclose post-accident testing information to the 
National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation. 
• 
The Company will make records available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of a 
written request from the Team Member.
