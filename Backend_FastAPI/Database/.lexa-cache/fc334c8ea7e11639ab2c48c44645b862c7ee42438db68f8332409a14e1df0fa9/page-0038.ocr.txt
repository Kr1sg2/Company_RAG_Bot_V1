Summary. The effects and symptoms of substance abuse provided in this material give you 
information that can help you determine when to require reasonable suspicion testing. It is not 
intended to be a complete course on alcohol or drug abuse. 
As a supervisor, your role is to know when a driver appears or behaves as if alcohol or drugs were 
abused. You are not required to know when someone has been using cocaine or any other specific 
drug. As previously mentioned, when in doubt of the substance used, it is generally best to require 
both alcohol and drug testing. Most importantly, be thoroughly familiar with your company’s 
alcohol and drug testing policy. Following the established rules offers you support and the 
knowledge that your actions are within the legal standards defined by the Department of 
Transportation and the Company. If a Team Member should approach the Company for assistance 
through rehabilitation for drug abuse or alcohol abuse prior to a testing request by the Company, 
all possible and positive consideration for a medical leave of absence for treatment and/or 
counseling will be pursued. If a Team Member is terminated, the Company will not be obligated 
to provide assistance beyond the last day of employment.
