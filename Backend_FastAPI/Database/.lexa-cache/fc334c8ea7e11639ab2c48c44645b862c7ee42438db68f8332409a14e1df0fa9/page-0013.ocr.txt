UNPAID TIME OFF (UPTO) 
Team Members must take all available PTO time before taking Unpaid Time Off (UPTO).  
Scheduled UPTO is to be requested by using the UPTO template in the timekeeping system in 
the same manner that PTO is requested.  UPTO must be requested in advance and approved by 
your manager.  In the event you have PTO available, you must use all PTO prior to requesting 
UPTO. 
 
Paid Time Off (PTO) Redemption Policy 
Eligible team members include all full-time, hourly (non-exempt) team members working at the 
Distribution Center or at a Showroom.  This policy does not apply to any team members who work 
offsite or are salaried (exempt).   
 
A minimum of 40 hours (or 5 days) of PTO time used per year is required.  Any unused PTO time 
beyond the 40 hours (or 5 days) can be redeemed as outlined below.   
 
50% of Wage 
Any amount of unredeemed PTO over 40 hours can be redeemed at 50% of the team member’s 
wage. To redeem your unused PTO, you must submit a PTO Redemption form, signed by your 
supervisor, to Human Resources 30 days prior to your anniversary date. The redeemed PTO pay 
will be paid on the paycheck following the team member’s anniversary.  Team Members will not 
be paid for PTO time prior to their anniversary date. 
 
How many PTO days do I have left? 
You will be able to see this information in the time management system.  You can find your used 
and available PTO hours under “Leave Management”.  The hours shown are the balance after all 
approved requests have been deducted.  To figure out how many days you have left from the 
Hours Balance you need to do the following calculation: 
 
 
 
 
PTO Days = Hours Balance divided by 8 hours 
For example, if you have 64.00 Hours Balance on your stub then to figure out how many PTO 
Days are remaining you would do:   
        64.00 Hours Balance divided by 8 hours = 8 PTO Days left to use.
