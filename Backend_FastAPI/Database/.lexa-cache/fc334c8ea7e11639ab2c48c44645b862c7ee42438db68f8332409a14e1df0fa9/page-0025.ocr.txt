Housekeeping 
Neatness and good housekeeping are signs of organization and efficiency.  You are expected to 
always keep your work area neat and orderly – this is a required safety precaution and creates a 
good impression for visitors.  
 
Easily accessible trash receptacles and recycling containers (where applicable) are located 
throughout the offices.  Please put all litter and recyclable materials in the appropriate receptacles 
and containers.  Always be aware of good health and safety standards, including fire and loss 
prevention.  Please report anything that needs repairing or replacing to your supervisor or the 
President immediately. 
Visitors in the Workplace 
To provide for the safety and security of Team Members and the facilities at Leaders Holding Co™, 
only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps 
maintain safety standards, protects against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects 
confidential information, safeguards Team Member welfare, and avoids potential distractions and 
disturbances.  
 
Because of safety and security reasons, family and friends of Team Members are discouraged 
from visiting warehouse and corporate Team Members.  In cases of emergency, Team Members 
will be called to meet any visitor outside their work area. 
 
All visitors should enter Leaders Holding Co™ at the main entrance. Authorized visitors will receive 
directions or be escorted to their destination. Team Members are responsible for the conduct and 
safety of their visitors. 
 
If an unauthorized individual is observed on Leaders Holding Co™ premises, Team Members 
should immediately notify their supervisor or, if necessary, direct the individual to the main 
entrance. 
Workplace Violence 
The company is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work 
environment.  The company has adopted the following guidelines to deal with threats of (or 
actual) violence that may occur during business hours or on its premises. 
 
All Team Members, including supervisors and temporary Team Members, should always be 
treated with courtesy and respect.  Team Members are expected to refrain from fighting, 
"horseplay," or other conduct that may be dangerous to others.  Weapons, and other dangerous 
or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the company. 
 
All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible 
to your immediate supervisor or any other member of management.  This includes threats by 
Team Members, as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the 
public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible.
