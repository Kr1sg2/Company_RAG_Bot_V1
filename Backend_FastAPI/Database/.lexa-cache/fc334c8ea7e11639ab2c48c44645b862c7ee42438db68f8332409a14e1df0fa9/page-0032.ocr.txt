TESTING METHODOLOGY: 
Only laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be used 
for drug urinalysis. Every specimen is required to undergo an initial screen followed by 
confirmation of all positive screen results. This screen-confirmation process utilizes highly 
sophisticated techniques to detect minute levels of prohibited substances in urine. 
 
Reporting of Results: 
The laboratory is required to report the test results directly to the Company's Medical Review 
Officer (MRO) within 5 working days. The report shall indicate the drug/metabolites tested for, 
whether the results are positive or negative, the specimen number assigned by the Company and 
the drug testing laboratory identification number. 
 
Review of Results/MRO: 
The medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician and possesses knowledge of drug abuse 
disorders. The MRO may be a Team Member of the Company or one contracted to provide the 
services required. The MRO will review and interpret positive results obtained from the 
laboratory. The MRO through a verification process will assess and determine whether alternate 
medical explanations could account for the positive test results. The MRO may conduct medical 
interviews of the Team Member, review the Team Member’s medical history and review any 
other relevant bio-medical factors. Additionally, the MRO will examine all medical records and 
data made available by the tested individual, such as evidence of prescribed medications. 
As a part of the verification process the MRO is prohibited from verifying a test negative based on 
information that a physician recommended that the Team Member use a drug listed in Schedule 
I of the Controlled Substances Act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such 
recommendations, such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states have adopted). 
The MRO will give the individual testing positive an opportunity to discuss the test results prior to 
making a final decision. After the final decision is made, the MRO will notify the Company as 
prescribed below. If during an interview with a Team Member who has tested positive, the MRO 
learns of a medical condition, which could, in the MRO's reasonable medical judgment, pose a risk 
to safety, the MRO may report that information to the Department of Transportation (DOT) or to 
the Company. 
The MRO will notify each Team Member who has a confirmed positive test that the Team Member 
has 72 hours in which to request a test of the split specimen. If the Team Member makes such a 
request, the MRO will direct, in writing, the laboratory to provide the split specimen to another 
certified laboratory for analysis. If the analysis of the split specimen fails to reconfirm the presence 
of the drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) found in the primary specimen, or if the split specimen is 
unavailable, inadequate for testing or not testable, the MRO will cancel the test and report 
cancellation and the reasons for it to the DOT, the Company, and the Team Member. A request 
for testing of the split sample and associated costs are the responsibility of the Team Member. If 
the MRO, after making and documenting all reasonable efforts, is unable to contact the tested 
person, the MRO will contact a designated management official of the Company to arrange for 
the Team Member to contact the MRO prior to going on duty. Within 5 days after a documented 
contact by designated management official of the Company instructing the Team Member to 
contact the MRO, the Team Member has not done so the MRO will verify the test positive and 
report it to the Company.
