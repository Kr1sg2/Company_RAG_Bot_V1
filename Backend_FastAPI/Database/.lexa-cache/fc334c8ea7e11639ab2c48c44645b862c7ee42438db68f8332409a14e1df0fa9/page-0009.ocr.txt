Pay Deductions 
The law requires that Leaders Holding Co™ make certain deductions from every Team Member's 
compensation.  Among these are applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Leaders 
Holding Co™ also must deduct Social Security taxes on each Team Member's earnings up to a 
specified limit that is called the Social Security "wage base."  Leaders Holding Co™ matches the 
amount of Social Security taxes paid by each Team Member. 
Pay Advances 
Leaders Holding Co™ does not provide pay advances on any wages to Team Members. 
Administrative Pay Corrections 
Leaders Holding Co™ takes all reasonable steps to ensure that Team Members receive the correct 
amount of pay and are paid promptly for each paycheck on the scheduled payday. 
 
In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the Team Member should 
promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of their supervisor or Human Resources so that 
corrections can be made as quickly as possible. 
Salary Administration 
The salary administration program at Leaders Holding Co™ was created to achieve consistent pay 
practices, comply with federal and state laws, mirror our commitment to Equal Employment 
Opportunity, and offer competitive salaries within our labor market.  Because recruiting and 
retaining talented Team Members is critical to our success, Leaders Holding Co™ is committed to 
paying its Team Members equitable wages that reflect the requirements and responsibilities of 
their positions and are comparable to the pay received by similarly situated Team Members in 
other organizations in the area. 
 
Compensation for every position is determined by several factors, including the essential duties 
and responsibilities of the job. 
Performance Evaluation 
Supervisors and Team Members are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals 
on an informal, day-to-day basis.  Performance evaluations are conducted annually according to 
your anniversary date.  This provides both you and your department manager with the 
opportunity to discuss your job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage, and recognize 
strengths, and discuss methods for improving your performance.  A Team Member may also be 
reviewed at any time the company feels it is warranted for commendation or required 
improvement.   
 
A positive performance evaluation does not guarantee an increase in salary, a promotion, or even 
continued employment.  Compensation increases and the terms and conditions of employment, 
including job assignments, transfers, promotions, and demotions, are determined by and at the 
discretion of your supervisor.
