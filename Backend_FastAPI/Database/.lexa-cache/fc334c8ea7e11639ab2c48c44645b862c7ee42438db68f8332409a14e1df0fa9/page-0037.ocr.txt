short-term insomnia;

grinding, anorexia, loss of coordination and physical collapse. 
Physical exertion increases the hazards of stimulants because these drugs already increase heart 
rate and blood pressure. Fatalities have been reported among athletes who have taken even 
moderate amounts of stimulants. 
 
E. Opiates 
Opiates, including heroin, morphine, and codeine are narcotics used to relieve pain and induce 
sleep. Common Street names are horse, hard stuff, morpho, M, brown sugar, Harry, Mr. H., junk 
and smack. Heroin accounts for 90% of the narcotic abuse in this country. Narcotics found in 
prescription medicines are sometimes abused. This includes pain relievers containing opium and 
cough syrups containing codeine. Heroin is illegal and cannot even be obtained with a physician’s 
prescription. 
Most medical problems are caused by the uncertain dosage level, use of unsterile needles, 
contamination of the drug, or combination of a narcotic with other drugs. These dangers depend 
on the specific drug, its source and the way it is used.

F. PCP 
Phencyclidine or PCP, also called angel dust, rocket fuel, super kools, and killer weed was 
developed as a surgical anesthetic in the late 1950’s. Later, due to its unusual side effects in 
humans, it was restricted to use as a veterinary anesthetic and tranquilizer. Today it has no lawful 
use and is no longer legally manufactured. PCP is a very dangerous drug. It can produce violent 
and bizarre behavior even in people not otherwise prone to such behavior. More people die from 
accidents caused by the erratic and unpredictable behavior produced by the drug than from the 
drug’s direct effect on the body. PCP scrambles the brain’s internal stimuli and alters how users 
see and deal with their environment.
