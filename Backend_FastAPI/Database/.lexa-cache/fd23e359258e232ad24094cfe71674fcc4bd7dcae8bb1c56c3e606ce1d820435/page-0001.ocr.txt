Applying Touch Up Paint 
CAUTION: One heavy coat may cause the surrounding 
finish to loosen and wrinkle due to the solvents in the 
spray paint. Do NOT try to get full coverage with the first 
coat. 
Small Nicks – Complete steps 1 – 5. Spray touch-up paint 
onto a flat plate or dish. Use a small artist's brush to transfer 
the paint from the plate to the aluminum outdoor patio 
furniture. If needed, the texture can be enhanced with a 
clean, dry brush after the paint becomes tacky (or see the 
texture match instruction on next page). 
Repairing Scratches and Scrapes 
Touch-up paint to match the frame color is available directly 
from your local Tropitone Dealer or Representative.  
1. Wash the scratched area to remove any dirt or grease.  
2. Rinse thoroughly with clean water. Dry. 
3. Remove cushions. Protect fabric, frame, and all 
surface areas that are not to be painted. 
4. Sand the scratch lightly to “soften” the edge with fine 
grit sandpaper so that the touch-up paint will blend in 
easily. Sand as small an area as possible so you don’t 
create additional work.  
5. Wipe away residue with lint free cloths dampened with 
rubbing alcohol until surface is clean.
