Touching Up Gloss Finishes 
6. Hold the can 4 – 6 inches away from the surface to be 
painted. Spray the touch-up paint with short light 
sprays until complete coverage is obtained and let dry.  
Be sure to avoid “over-spraying” onto adjacent areas. 
Over-spray must be removed immediately using 
rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth. 
7. If necessary, spray a second coat and with short light 
sprays until complete coverage is obtained and let dry.  
 
 
Touching Up Textured Finishes 
Texture match - If necessary, after last coat, don’t let the 
paint fully dry. Wait 3 - 5 minutes for the paint to become 
tacky. Pat with a damp, lint free cloth (not soaking) to create 
texture (a dry cloth will pick up too much paint).  
6. Hold spray can 4 - 6 inches away from surface to be 
painted. Spray a thin coat and let dry.  
7. Spray a second coat and let dry. Repeat until desired 
coverage is achieved.  
CAUTION: Trying to get full coverage in the first coat 
may result in a glossy surface. Should this happen, 
dull with a light (thin) coat applied after the offending 
glossy coat has dried.  
8. Certain colors require a second coat with a supplied 
“Step 2” spray paint. Hold the can 12 inches from the 
surface and use one quick pass. Allow to dry. 
9. Certain colors require a third coat with a supplied 
“Step 3” spray paint. Hold the can 12 inches from the 
surface and use one quick pass. Allow to dry.

PAINT STORAGE HINT 
 Always flush the paint out of the nozzle after use by turning 
the can upside down and depressing the nozzle, spraying 
onto a disposable cloth. Store touch-up spray cans upside 
down as the nozzles are less likely to clog.
