Do you know about Powder Coating? 
 
Powder Coat Finishing is three times thicker than paint, ensuring that your furniture will shrug off sun 
and storm, season after season. 
What is Powder Coating? 
By far the youngest of surface finishing techniques, Powder coating is an advanced 
method of applying a decorative and protective finish to a wide range of materials 
and products.  Color and texture selections are limitless, ranging from smooth 
surfaces with high-gloss to wrinkled and matte finishes.  The color choices are 
virtually unlimited, including clear coats. 
What makes Powder Coat Finishes “Green”? 
Unlike Liquid paint finishes that contain solvents and pollutants known as volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), Powder Coat finishes contain no solvents and release only a negligible amount, if any VOCs into 
the atmosphere.  Also because most powder coating overspray does not adhere to the part, it can be 
retrieved and reused, virtually eliminating the waste commonly found in liquid finishing. 
How is a Powder Coat Finish Applied? 
Before a Powder Coat finish is applied it is essential that the 
piece is prepared properly by removing any oil, soil, greases, 
etc.  This is done a variety of methods including chemical 
washes or sand-blasting which usually take multiple steps to 
clean completely.  Finely ground particles of pigment and 
resin are then electro-statically charged and sprayed using 
compressed air onto the products to be coated.  The parts to 
be coated are then electro-statically grounded, so that the 
particles adhere to them.  The piece is then heated in a 
curing oven where the particles fuse into a uniform smooth coating. 
Why is Powder Coating better than conventional Painting? 
One of the most economical, longest-lasting and durable finishes available, Powder Coated surfaces are 
more resistant to chipping, scratching, heat, stains, UV damage and wearing than other finishes.  The 
colors also stay bright and vibrant longer.  The powder coat finish, once complete, is much thicker and 
more even than conventional liquid coatings without running or sagging.
