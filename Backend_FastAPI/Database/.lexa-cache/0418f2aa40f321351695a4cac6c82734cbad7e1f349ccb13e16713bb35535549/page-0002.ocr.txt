11/07/2017 
Who uses Powder Coat Finishing? 
Powder Coat finishing is the fastest-growing finishing technology in North America and is mainly used 
for coating metals; including aluminum furniture, appliances, automotive parts, sporting goods and 
countless other products. 
What is the best way to clean furniture with a Powder Coat Finish? 
Most stains on aluminum patio furniture can be removed with mild soap or detergent.  You should avoid 
using abrasive cleaners so not to damage the finish, diminishing the benefits of a Powder Coat finish.  
For non-textured, smooth gloss finishes only, you can periodically wax the furniture frame with 
automotive paste wax to help restore the luster of your finish.  However textured finishes should be 
cleaned with mild soap and water only.
