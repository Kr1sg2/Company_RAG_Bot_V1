Customer’s Own Material (COM) 
Occasionally a customer will want cushions made in a fabric other than what the manufacturer 
carries, or they are simply trying to get two upholstered/cushioned items from two different 
companies to match with the same fabric.  This can be accomplished with a “C.O.M.” (Customers 
Own Material) 
In order to track the roll of fabric through our vast inventory, you will need to follow the following 
procedure.  The fabric will get lost if the procedure is not followed.  
 
There are two types of C.O.M.: 
✓ If the fabric is purchased at Leaders Casual Furniture®  (example: Buying Windward 
seating, using fabric from Central Cushion) 
✓ If the customer brings in their own fabric from an outside source (example: Buying Bali 
seating, using fabric from Joann’s®) 
PLEASE QUOTE EXTRA TIME ON YOUR ORDERS IF THEY 
INVOLVE C.O.M. FABRIC
