Mildew may form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the 
fabric. Regular cleaning of the furniture will help to prevent its 
forming. 
 If mildew does develop, add 1 cup bleach to the cleaning 
solution. Apply to the affected area and allow to soak in. Scrub 
with a soft bristle brush, then rinse thoroughly. Repeat if 
necessary. For stubborn mildew stains, use a household mildew 
remover – test in an inconspicuous location first.  
FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS.
