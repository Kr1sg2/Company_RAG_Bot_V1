FABRIC 
 
The life of your furniture fabric largely depends on its care. 
Clean all spills promptly. Fabric life can be extended by simply 
rinsing down the furniture regularly with water. Certain suntan 
and sun block products may permanently discolor any fabric. 
This possibility can be minimized by immediately cleaning after 
contact. In addition, storing the cushions when not in use will  
extend cushion life.  
 
Prepare a cleaning solution with 1/4 cup (2 oz.) mild 
biodegradable liquid soap in a gallon of lukewarm water (no 
warmer than 100ยบ F / 38ยบ C). Clean fabric with the solution 
using a sponge or soft bristle brush. Rinse thoroughly with clean 
water. Allow to air dry.  
 
***HINT: Standing a cushion on its side will help it drain 
faster. *** 
 
CAUTION: Certain suntan and sun block products contain 
"PABA". PABA is harmful to fabric and can permanently 
discolor it; therefore, contact with cushions or slings should be 
avoided. If contact is made, cleaning the fabric immediately 
with a non-abrasive, mild biodegradable soap and water solution 
followed by a fresh water rinse may minimize the possibility of 
discoloration. Laying a beach towel over the cushions or slings 
of outdoor furniture whenever you are using the furniture will 
prolong the fabric life.
