Laptop Purchase Plan 
Leaders Furniture’s Sales Team Members have the opportunity to purchase a new preselected laptop 
through Leaders.  Having a laptop to use with your guests will help you stay closer to your selling 
opportunity, allow you to look up information faster, and reduce your transaction time. 
Laptop Purchase Program Guidelines 
✓ Purchase requests should be emailed to; sales.leadership@leadersfurniture.com for approval.  
✓ The laptop is purchased by the team member and is the personal property of the team member.  
o Leaders’ IT team will not maintain or support the laptop. 
o The intent is to use for both personal and businesses purposes and as such when in use 
in a Leaders showroom the laptop must present in a professional manner free of any 
potentially offensive or controversial messaging (stickers, screensavers, etc.). 
✓ All retail sales members employed 90 days or more qualify for the purchase program. 
✓ Standard specifications include no less than: 
o Modern standards able to interact with Leaders selling systems. 
o A current version of Windows.

o 15” or larger screen. 
✓ Pricing 
o Will be at market value at the time of purchase. 
o Three options will be provided to the team member for review. 
o Pricing on all three options will be communicated back to the team member for 
approval before purchase is made. 
o The team member must commit to purchase within 48 hours of receiving the pricing. 
After 48 hours the quoted pricing will then become invalid. 
o If a team member wants to commit and move forward to purchase a laptop, please 
email sales.leadership@leadersfurniture.com with your approval and payment option. 
✓ Payment Options 
o In full.  Through a one-time payroll deduction or check. 
o 6-month payroll deduction plan.  An equal amount will be deducted each payroll. 
o Payroll deduction will commence the first payroll cycle after receipt of delivery. 
➢ Delivery 
o Delivery of the laptop will go to the shipping address designated by the team member.
