STONE TOP
FEATURES AND CARE:
  
Natural stone is a creation of nature.  With proper care, it can provide you with a  lifetime of beauty and pleasure. 
Every piece is unique. Within each piece of stone lies the history of one particular place and time on our planet. 
The luster, hardness, colors and variation are all indications of the stoneâ€™s material composition and origin. 
This unique blend of characteristics is what makes your natural stone a one of a kind,  beautiful yet 
practical surface for your home.  
Natural stone must be properly cared for. Although we usually think of stone as  hard, it is a porous material. 
If left unsealed, spills can easily penetrate the surface and  leave stains. Highly acidic substances such as 
citrus juice, tomato products,  coffee and wine will also etch the stone and leave dull marks.   
CLEANING:
  
Regularly use a natural PH balanced cleaner specially formulated for stone. 
DO NOT use any acidic, abrasive or harsh chemicals. 
Plain water is acceptable to wipe up after normal use.   
SEALING:
  
The top should be sealed with stone sealer at least twice a year. Stone Care International (SCI) (stonecare.com) offers many 
fine products specifically formulated for the care and maintenance of stone surfaces. Most home improvement stores offer 
a selection of natural stone care products. The best way to prevent stains is to treat the surface with a protective sealer. 
The sealer fills in the pores and repels spills on the  surface, allowing you time to completely wipe it clean.  
With proper care, your natural stone top will provide years of proud ownership.  
Remember, it is a beautiful natural product that cannot be duplicated!
