Re-keying a Showroom 
 Every store is required to get three quotes so we can update our re-key files.  Please list the 
quotes in the area provided below and keep this filed in your cash wrap book. 
 Every store is to make 1 key for each store team member, plus 7 additional keys (for Tim 
Newton, (4) Sales Leadership, Inventory team Lead, & Maintenance team Lead). 
 Do not get your store re-keyed on the weekend.  You will get charged more from the lock 
company.
