Roof or soffit-mount brackets: 
If it is determined that the awning cannot be mounted to the wall, the other 2 mounting options, either 
roof or soffit, can be used for the install.  
 
All orders are priced with the correct number of wall brackets based on the size of the awning 
 
If the install is using either of the other 2 options, we check the pricing chart to determine how 
many wall brackets were needed based on the size of the awning. We then substitute the same 
number of either bracket to the invoice.  
 
There is an upcharge for either bracket 
o $30.00 for each soffit bracket needed 
o $60.00 for each roof bracket needed 
 
In the example below, I highlighted the number of wall mount brackets for a particular size 
along with the upcharge to include for each roof mount bracket. The customer is paying the 
difference between wall mount brackets and the roof brackets.  
o So in this case, the customer would pay an additional $240.00 for the 4 roof mount 
brackets, since each one is an additional $60.00. 
o If it was a soffit mount install, they would pay $120.00 for 4 soffit mount brackets, which 
is the difference between those and the wall mount brackets, since each one is an 
additional $30.00.
