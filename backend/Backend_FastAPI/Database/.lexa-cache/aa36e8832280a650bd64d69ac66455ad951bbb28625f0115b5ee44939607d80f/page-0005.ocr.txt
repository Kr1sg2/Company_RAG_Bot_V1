Setting an on-site pre-inspection: 
The customer has decided to move forward, selected the awning style and has placed an order. We 
need to schedule an on-site pre-inspection. This is done to confirm that the awning can be installed as 
ordered, and make sure everything is being ordered correctly. 
 
3 different pricelists based on the zone for each store location. The only difference is the cost of 
the inspection, and who is doing it.

o Brady Hummer does the pre-inspection for both zone A and B, but the difference in cost 
is the travel time. 
 
In order to have Brady come and do the pre-inspection, the following form must 
be signed by the customer at the store: R:\POP Signs\Pricelist & 
Information\Solair - Trivantage\Installation Agreement FOR 
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,19,20,22.pdf 
o Trivantage has their own certified installer that does the pre-inspection for zone C 
 
The customer will get half of this fee off of the installation charge, if the order goes forward. The 
customer must be made aware that if for any reason the order cannot move forward, they will 
not get back any portion of this fee. 
 
The FROG entry should have either BHUM-INSPECT or TRIV-INSPECT on it with the 
corresponding fee, and purchasing will arrange for inspection.  
Solair® Awning Order Form 
Once the customer places the order, the following form must be sent to 
purchasing1@leadersfurniture.com
