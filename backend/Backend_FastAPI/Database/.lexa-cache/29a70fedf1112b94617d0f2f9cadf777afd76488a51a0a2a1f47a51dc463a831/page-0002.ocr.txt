Introduction 
We live in a time when consumers are bombarded with opportunities to buy from local, international 
and global marketers. Consumers can buy online, in a store, via a catalog, or from house calls. There are 
so many brands and products competing for potential purchases it is vital to stand out in the crowd. 
At Leader’s, we have a very loyal following. We have competitive advantages of price, selection, fast 
delivery, 36 month financing, the best online reputation, multi store buying power and you/a team 
committed to the guest experience.  We have a soft-sell approach that customers seem to appreciate. 
To maintain and grow our customer base we must find ways to keep a healthy relationship with our 
customers so they come back to us plus tell their family and friends about Leader’s.  
In this time of technological ease of shopping, consumers still want a human contact to validate the 
information they have discovered online, they want to touch and feel major purchases, and to have a 
relationship with someone they trust. 
We can easily fulfill these wants of our guests.  
 We listen to what they have to say  
 We ask about their space and how they want to furnish it. 
 We use the room planner to help make the design and decision process simple. 
 We only offer a limited selection based on the customers’ needs out of our large 
selection. 
 When we use free fabric samples to help customers feel confident in their choices. 
 When we put forth effort to make guests feel comfortable in our stores and happy 
about their selection.
