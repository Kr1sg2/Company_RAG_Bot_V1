Why will they remember and buy from me? 
Staying in touch with our guests and purchasers is the most important way to maintain and grow a 
relationship with them. We have these tools in place to make it easy: 
 Ballot box entries to develop a contact record 
with new guests. Carry blanks in your pocket. 
 Thank you notes to send to visitors or buyers. 
Write and mail as soon as possible. 
 Email templates for you to use to send digital 
messages 
 Prior customer lists for many years that have 
addresses and phone numbers 
 A follow up Prospect file on Google Chrome 
that allows you to make and search records 
quickly and view from anywhere  
Prospect File 
Go to Google Chrome, click on Apps, then on Sheets or find your store copy here:
