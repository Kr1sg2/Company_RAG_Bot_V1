When is the best time to send a note or message? 
Immediately! Be the first your customer hears from. There are plenty of other 
retailers attempting to persuade your guest to buy from them. Stand out early! 
In the past, sales teams kept hand-written books and files. Can you imagine the time it took to enter and 
then search for names, addresses, contact information or what they bought? Today, we can record far 
more information faster and can access it in a fraction of the time. Technology is a great assistant in this 
process. Use Google Chrome as your personal secretary to search your customer and guest history so 
you will be remembered and referred. Make your business about you not just about Leader’s.  
 
Thank you cards are required for eligibility for bonus. You must send cards to 50% of your purchasers 
to earn eligibility. If you need help determining what that figure is, please ask.
