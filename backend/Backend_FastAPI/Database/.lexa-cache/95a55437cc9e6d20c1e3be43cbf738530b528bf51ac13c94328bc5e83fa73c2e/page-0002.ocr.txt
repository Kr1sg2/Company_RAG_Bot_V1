0.2 History Of Leader's 
11/08/2017 
With Leader’s added to the name the goal was clear; Leader’s Casual Furniture® would strive to 
become the dominant supplier of the finest selection of "Casual Home Furnishings" in the United 
States.   
In 1978 Jerry Newton (President and primary principle) was a 
successful Operations Manager at NCR, a corporation that 
processed business records and entered them into a large 
computer database.  Jerry’s success earned him a promotion to 
the NCR national headquarters in Dayton, Ohio.  Jerry, who is a 
Florida native born in St. Petersburg, had no interest in moving 
his young family north to Ohio.  The Newtons enjoy camping, 
boating, and anything to do with the outdoors.  A shortened 
summer and cold winter with ice and snow were not an option.  
When Jerry realized that the only way to continue to climb the ladder at NCR was to move to 
Ohio, he resigned to look for another opportunity. 
Fresh from a computer background at NCR and 29 years old, 
Jerry Newton became involved with the company in 1979.  
He heard of an opportunity through a friend of a friend that 
Casual Furniture was looking for owner operators to expand.  
Jerry opened the Bradenton showroom in 1979.    Many years 
later it was discovered that Jerry’s showroom had been 
stocked by the company with scratch and dent and left over 
inventory.  Despite this, under the influence of Jerry’s energy 
and management, the Bradenton showroom became the top 
store in the company the first year it was open.  In 1980, 
excited about the success of the Bradenton showroom, Jerry relocated his family and opened an 
additional showroom in Sarasota.  Linda Newton (Treasurer and primary principle), employed as 
a medical assistant, started helping Jerry keep the stores successful on her days off. 
 
Linda and Jerry received the opportunity to buy controlling interest in the company in 1986.  Their 
focus on employees, efficient systems, and building a stable company positioned Leader’s for 
accelerated stable growth.  In 1993 Jerry and Linda purchased 100% of the company stock.
