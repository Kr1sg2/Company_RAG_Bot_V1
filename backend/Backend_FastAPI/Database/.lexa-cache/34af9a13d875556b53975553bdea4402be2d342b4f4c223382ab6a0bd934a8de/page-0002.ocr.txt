 “Double Doweled” refers to the rattan leg being drilled out in the center ¾” where we epoxy in a hard wood 
dowel since rattan is a very fibrous wood.  Then an aluminum band is fit over the end of the entire leg – 
which is covered with leather-binding.  Once in our warehouse – we drill the center of the hard wood dowel 
& glue in a nylon thimble which locks the caster in place and does not allow it to fall out even if the chair is 
picked up from the floor 
 Metal T-joints used to reinforce where the chair leg meets the foot ring 
 
 
 Mechanism is bolted by T-nuts into the bucket of the chair 
 
 
 Non-stick pads are placed over the T-nuts to protect the fabric of the cushion and to ensure it does not slip
