Caster Dining Chairs 
All of our castered dining chairs are made exactly alike.  We use commercial/contract specifications for almost all of 
our designs which mean they are constructed in a way to withstand regular use in a hotel, motel, restaurant, or 
condo association environment. 
Here is a listing of our features/benefits: 
 Smaller rattan poles called “beads” are attached anywhere two larger rattan poles meet for a detailed 
finished look 
 There are no open areas where poles or wood meet that might capture food 
 Screwed, glued, doweled & leather-bound joints  
 Double doweled & reinforced perpendicular leg to ensure stability 
 
 Fine oil based stain over top & bottom for a detailed finish 
 All metal body caster.  Most of the industry uses a plastic wheel.
