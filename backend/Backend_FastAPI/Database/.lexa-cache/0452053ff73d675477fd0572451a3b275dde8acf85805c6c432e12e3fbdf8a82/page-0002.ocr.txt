6. Separate Arm Pole from Tilt Assembly
by gently pulling it apart.
7. Pull umbrella cord thru until attached
string is all-the-way thru.
8. Cut the string and secure the string end
to avoid slipping back into Arm Pole.
*** You will have to re-attach in order
to pull the whole cord back thru to lower
hub, therefore leave yourself enough 
slack.
