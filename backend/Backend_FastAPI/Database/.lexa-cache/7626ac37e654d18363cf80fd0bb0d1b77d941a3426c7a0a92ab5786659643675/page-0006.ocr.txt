Batteries  
• The 3D wind sensor is 
powered by two triple A 
batteries. 
• It is important to check the 
proper installation of the 
batteries for positive (+) 
and negative (-) directions 
as the sensor has two  
springs on one side of the 
battery chamber. The 
spring is usually reserved 
for the negative side on 
domestically produced 
electronics.
