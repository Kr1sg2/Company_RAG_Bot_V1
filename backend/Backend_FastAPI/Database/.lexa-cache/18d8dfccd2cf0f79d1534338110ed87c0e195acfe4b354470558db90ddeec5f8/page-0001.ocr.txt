 How to Clean Fire Glass Crystals 
1. Remove the fire glass from your fire pit or fireplace. Be careful of any small 
pieces of broken glass; this is a great time to sweep those into the trash. 
2. Wear protective gloves when handling fire pit glass. Especially important 
when touching Original or Crushed fire glass, gloves will ensure you avoid 
contact with any sharp edges. 
3. Put the fire glass into a strainer in small batches.
