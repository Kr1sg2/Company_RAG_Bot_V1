That’s it! It’s easy to keep your fire glass clean. Many of our customers rotate 
their fire glass seasonally, changing colors throughout the year. If that’s you, 
the transition between different types or colors of fire glass is the perfect 
opportunity to clean your glass. Wash the fire glass, let it dry, and then bag it 
up until the next time you plan to use it! It’ll be shining like new when the 
seasons change again.
