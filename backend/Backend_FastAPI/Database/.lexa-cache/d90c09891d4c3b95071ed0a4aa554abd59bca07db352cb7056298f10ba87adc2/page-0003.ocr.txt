0.2 History Of Leader's 
11/08/2017 
The transformation to an industry leading company did not happen overnight.  It has always been 
the opinion of Leader's Casual Furniture’s ownership to grow steadily 
and under control.  In order to keep this control, the Leader's Casual 
Furniture® distribution system has always been at the forefront of 
technology.  Leader’s has had information technology and computer 
systems in place since the first commercial computer, the Radio Shack 
TRS-80, came out in 1979.  This system was primarily used for 
accounting.  A Tyler system was implemented in 1988 to automate 
inventory management, accounting, buying, sales analyses, and 
begin a point of sales system.  In 1993 FROG (Furniture Retail 
Organization Group) was implemented.  FROG is a fully integrated 
furniture company management system that controls all facets of 
the business.  In order to continue on the company’s quest to utilize 
technology to be as efficient as possible and to make decisions 
based on real time data the warehouse management portion was split off FROG and on to the 
more advanced BoxKeeper system in 2010.  Many of our casual furniture industry competitors 
still operate with no business or inventory management systems today. 
The first warehouse was leased in the mid 70’s in St. Petersburg, FL.  At approximately 15,000 
square feet it was more than adequate for Leader’s 2 
Showrooms.  In 1983 Leaders grew to a 4 Store chain 
and it was time to find a larger distribution center 
located in Clearwater.  This facility served the 
company needs till 1994.  This warehouse supported 
9 showrooms.  From 1995 To 2003 Leader's Casual 
Furniture® was in a 52,000 square foot facility also in 
Clearwater.  This was adequate until the company 
reached record volume.  
In 2004 Leader's Casual Furniture® moved into their current state of the art facility.  All Leader's 
Casual Furniture® showrooms are supported by one massive 170,000 square foot distribution 
center which is 56 ft high.  With its towering ceiling and large square footage, the building has 
approximately 5,000,000 cubic feet of storage space.
