Reminders 
All team members should set this list to not show a reminder with Zero results.  Setting reminders this way makes it a 
“to-do list,” alerting agents of tasks they need to complete.  Please ask for help if your reminders list is showing Zeros. 
Reminders on the reminders list show a Solutions Team member exactly which case needs attention and why.  The 
reminders list will direct the Solutions Team through the most efficient day possible.   
 
 
Solutions | Escalated Cases 
Criteria:  
Case(s) with Escalated Priority, regardless of who the case is assigned to. 
Goal:  
Alert the entire team of an escalated case so that any available solutions team member can take more 
immediate action. 
Solutions | My Cases to Respond To 
Criteria:  
Case(s) assigned to the user in which the system shows no response to an incoming customer or store inquiry 
about the case.   
Goal:  
Alert the assigned team member that an inquiry has been made on one of their cases and we need to reply.  If we 
do not reply directly to the customer through NetSuite, when we add notes to the case, uncheck the ‘Internal 
Only’ box so that the system knows we have had external communication regarding the case with the guest.
