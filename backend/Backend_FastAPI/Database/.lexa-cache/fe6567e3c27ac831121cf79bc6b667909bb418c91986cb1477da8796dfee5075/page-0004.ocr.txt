2. Check for Fuel Flow 
Non-Thermocouple Equipped Pit 
You can tell your pit does not have a thermocouple if it does not have a firebox.  See page three for an image of 
a firebox. 
For a short amount of time, turn the gas valve on using the knob or key.  Can you hear a slight hiss or smell the 
gas?  
Yes – Proceed to check your spark. 
No – Recheck your connection to the tank. 
Try another propane tank; yours may be empty.  If you are uncertain, you can get an inexpensive tank 
gauge from a home improvement store or online.  There is an image of the gauge for your reference 
on the last page.   
 
Thermocouple Equipped Pit 
A thermocouple-equipped pit will not use a gas key and will have a valve similar to a gas grill on the side.  Rotate 
the valve 90 degrees until it clicks.  Push the valve into the pilot light position for a few seconds.  Can you hear a 
slight hiss or smell the gas.  
Yes – Proceed to check your spark. 
No – Check the position of the valve and make sure it is in the light position.  You may need to read the 
instruction next to the valve for a more complete understanding.

3. Check Your Ignition Source  
Do not check your ignition source if you smell gas.  Wait for the smell to dissipate before continuing on.   
Traditional Lighter 
Ignite the lighter as recommended by the manufacturer.  If it works, you are ready to 
get started.  
Electric Lighter 
Press the ignition button on the electric lighter.  You should hear a repetitive clicking sound.  This is the sound of 
the spark from the electric lighter.  The sound is the same as an electric light grill or gas stove.  If you do not hear 
the clicks, check the polarity of the battery or replace the batteries.  Batteries are located behind the ignition 
button or in the etank cabinet on the back side of the ignition button.
