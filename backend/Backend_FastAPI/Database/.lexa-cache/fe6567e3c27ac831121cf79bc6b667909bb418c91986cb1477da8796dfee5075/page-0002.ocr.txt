Safety 
Propane fire pits are a gas appliance and a gas system.  Please follow these simple safety steps. 
 
✓ Only use your fire pit in a well-ventilated area.  Failure to use your fire pit in a well-vented area can lead to: 
o A buildup of carbon dioxide  
o A buildup of unburnt gas that can lead to explosion. 
✓ Only use approved material in the burner pan.  Going to the home improvement store to buy a bag of rocks can 
be very dangerous.  As the rocks heat, any moisture trapped inside of them turns to steam causing the rocks to 
explode. 
Gas Fire Pit Systems 
Gas fire pits are a simple system, when used properly, are a safe way to enjoy the ambiance and warmth of a fire 
without all the work.  To have a fire, you need a fuel source: the gas, and an ignition source, such as a lighter.  Some fire 
pits have built-in electric lighters, but we will cover that later.   
Propane Tank 
Standard Propane Tank 
Most fire pits take a standard 20lbs grill tank.  The upright tanks are readily available and can be refilled or 
swapped out at many locations.  The standard 20lbs tank is made to be used upright and should never be laid 
on its side.  This is because the emergency vent system on the tank will not function correctly if it is laid down. 
Horizontal Tanks  
Horizontal tanks are made for fire pits with a low table height.  They are designed to 
lay on their side and still vent properly. 
Regulator and Hose 
The regulator and hose screw onto the tank and burner.  It reduces the pressure coming out of the tank and transfers 
the gas from the tank to the burner.  These items are extremely reliable and rarely need replacing.   
 
Gas Valve 
The fire pit valve is how the flame height is controlled.  Some gas valves have a safety device called a thermocouple.  A 
thermocouple must be heated to allow gas to continue to flow.  This means that if the flame blows out in the fire box 
where the thermocouple is located, the thermocouple will cool and stop gas flow.  The thermocouple safety device is 
one of the most misunderstood parts of a fire pit and is the reason that many owners believe their pit will not light.  The 
lighting process for a fire pit with a thermocouple is explained in detail later in this document.  Trouble shooting for fire 
pits is at the end of the document.
