I cannot connect the gas line 
to my horizontal tank 
Horizontal tanks have welded 
guards over the valve that make 
alignment critical when 
connecting a horizontal tank 
1. Angle the connection back toward the 
tank to gain the necessary clearance.   
2. Not all tanks are made the same.  If it If it 
still does not fit add a propane tank gauge 
as shown on page 7. 
I do not hear gas when I test 
for fuel 
Gas is not flowing from the 
supply to the burner 
1. Check to make sure you are using a tank with gas 
2. An overfilled horizontal tank will not work.  A horizontal 
20lbs tank should not weigh more than 37lbs full 
3. Make sure the tank is turned on.  You can read the top of 
the valve if your uncertain which way to turn it 
4. On thermocouple equipped fire pits, there is only one 
position that allows you to push the valve in and override 
the thermocouple.  This position is usually 90 degrees 
from the full off position.  If you do not have the valve in 
this position, you will not be able to push the valve in and 
allow the flow of gas 
5. Reset the valve.  Turning a tank on to fast can set off a 
safety.  Turn off the gas, disconnect the pit.  Make sure 
the firepit is turned off.  Reconnect everything and turn 
the propane tank on slowly.   
I do not hear a spark when I 
test my electric ignitor 
Either the battery is dead or the 
electrode is too far away from 
the ground.   
1. Replace the battery.  Make sure that the polarity of the 
replacement battery is correct.  Plus to plus, negative to 
negative.  The ignitor will not work correctly if the polarity 
is not correct. 
2. The electrode is in the firebox.  If the battery is fresh and 
the spark is not traveling far enough to jump from the 
electrode to the ground, bend the electrode towards the 
ground, pilot light until the spark is able to jump. 
My thermocouple equipped 
fire pit will not stay lit on 
start-up 
1. Your tank is running out of or 
ran out of gas 
2. The pilot light is not being 
held down long enough to heat 
the thermocouple 
3. The thermocouple 
attachment point on the back of 
the control valve is loose   
1. Check to make sure your tank is full and the valve is on.   
2. Follow the lighting instructions for the thermocouple 
equipped pit and hold the gas valve down in the light 
position for at least 20 seconds. 
3. Snug the screw on the back of the control valve with pliers 
or a wrench.  See the thermocouple screw image on the 
next page for location. 
My fire pit was working great 
and just turned off. 
1. Your tank is low on gas or has 
run out 
2. The pilot light went out in the 
firebox, and the thermocouple 
cooled off and shut the gas off 
1. Check your tank and make sure you have gas.  An 
inexpensive inline gauge is a good way to check.  See the 
image on the next page. 
2. Move some of the fire pit material away from the firebox 
so the pilot flame can breathe and stay lit.  See the image 
on the next page for location. 
I smell gas after my fire pit 
has been lit for several 
minutes. 
Unburnt gas is leaking 
1. Replace your propane tank.  Many tanks in the exchange 
program have leaky valves. 
2. Make sure the regulator and hose are tightly attached to 
the tank.   
3. If you continue to smell, gas discontinue use immediately 
and contact our Solutions Center for help.
