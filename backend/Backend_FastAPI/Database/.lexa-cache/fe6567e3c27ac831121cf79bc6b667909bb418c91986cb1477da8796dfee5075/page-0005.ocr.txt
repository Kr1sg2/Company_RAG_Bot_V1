Light the Fire 
Traditional Lighter, No Thermocouple 
1. Turn on the gas at the propane tank. 
2. Create a flame with the lighter and hold the flame as close as possible to the burner. 
3. Turn the gas valve on the fire pit on to allow gas to flow. 
4. The lighter will light the gas as it flows through the burner. 
5. Adjust the height of the flame. 
6. Enjoy! 
7. When turning the fire pit off, it is good practice to turn off both the fire pit gas valve, and the gas valve at the 
tank. 
Electric Lighter with Thermocouple 
1. Take your time.  Remember that your fire pit has a safety device (thermocouple) that must heat up for your fire 
pit to perform as expected. 
2. Turn on the gas at the propane tank. 
3. Press the electric lighter button. 
4. Do you hear it spark? 
a. Yes – Continue to the next step. 
b. No – Replace the battery. 
5. Turn the gas valve on the fire pit 90 degrees to the light position and press the knob of the valve in, to override 
the thermocouple.  You will know if you are in the correct position if you can noticeably push the valve in further 
than any other position of the valve. 
6. As soon as the pit lights you can release the electric ignitor and do not release the pressed knob of the gas valve.  
Keep the gas valve knob pressed for 15 to 20 seconds to allow the thermocouple to warm. 
7. Release the gas valve.  Did the flame stay on? 
a. Yes – proceed to the next step. 
b. No – Start back at step 3.  The thermocouple did not warm enough to allow the gas to flow. 
c. If you still have difficulty, please go to the troubleshooting section 
8. Adjust the flame to your desired level. 
9. Enjoy! 
10. When turning the fire pit off, it is good practice to turn off both the fire pit gas valve, and the gas valve at the 
tank.
