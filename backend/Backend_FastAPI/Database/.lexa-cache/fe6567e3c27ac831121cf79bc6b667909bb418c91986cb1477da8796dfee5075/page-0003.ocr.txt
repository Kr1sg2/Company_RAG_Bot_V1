Burner 
Burners come in many shapes and sizes.  The burner is where the gas is dispensed to 
fuel the flame.  In other words, this is where the magic happens.  You can choose to 
cover your burner completely or leave it exposed, it is your choice.  The deeper the 
burner is covered, the more the gas will burn in a random pattern. 
 
Fire Box 
Some burner assemblies have a firebox.  If your fire pit is equipped 
with a firebox, the heat conductor part of the thermocouple safety 
device.  You may also find a flame pilot light and electric lighter 
located in the firebox.. 
Never cover the top of your firebox.  This will insulate the heat and 
prevent the thermocouple from working properly.   
Allow some space around your firebox for the pilot light to breathe.  
Too much material around a firebox can cause the pilot to go out 
and the pit to shut off unexpectedly. 
Lighter Style 
Fire pits are lit in one of two ways, a traditional lighter or a built-in electric spark.  Electric light fire pits can also be lit 
with a traditional lighter.
