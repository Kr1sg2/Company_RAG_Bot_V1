Fiber Glass Spring 
Plate Installation 
 
Most outdoor furniture swivel chairs use two 
spring plates which allow the chair to rock 
back and forth.  Overtime, the fiber glass 
spring plates eventually weaken through 
extended use and from being exposed to 
the outdoor elements resulting in the 
softening of the spring plates or breakage.  
If you find that your outdoor swivel chair has 
too much rocking action it may be time to 
replace the fiber glass spring plates on the 
swivel bases of your patio chairs. 
Chair Care patio makes it easy for anyone 
to repair the fiber glass spring plates of their 
outdoor patio furniture. Chair Care Patio 
furniture repair offers two sizes of fiber glass 
spring plates, 2½” x 5” and 3” x 5”.  
Measure the original fiber glass spring 
plates of your outdoor patio furniture to 
determine the size of the replacement parts 
needed. 
 
 
Begin by removing the original spring plates 
from your outdoor swivel chair.  Pay close 
attention to how your outdoor furniture chair 
frame is assembled and take pictures if 
needed.  The chair frame will be 
reassembled in the same fashion so it is 
important to take note of how your outdoor 
patio chair came apart.
