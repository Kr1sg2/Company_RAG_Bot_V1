With the spring plates lined up in position, 
drill through the holes in the original spring 
plate and into the new spring plate.  Chair 
Care Patio furniture repair suggests using a 
3/8‚Äù drill bit for this process 
 
 
After drilling the holes in the new fiber glass 
spring plates, the replacement spring plates 
can be spray painted to match your outdoor 
patio chair frame.  For best results Char 
Care Patio recommends lightly sand the 
new spring plates with fine sand paper 
before spray painting. 
 
 
Once dry, install the new replacement 
spring plates to your outdoor patio furniture 
chairs using the original hardware. 
 
This completes the installation of fiberglass 
spring plates for swivel base patio furniture 
chairs.
