It is very important to keep all the original 
hardware that has been removed from your 
outdoor chair frame as it will be needed for 
re-installation of the replacement parts 
offered by Chair Care Patio. 
 
The fiber glass spring plate replacement 
parts offered by Chair Care Patio do not 
ship with pre-drilled holes. Before 
installation of you new fiber glass spring 
plates, four holes will need to be drilled in 
the same position as the holes in the 
original spring plates removed from your 
chair frame. 
 
Chair Care Patio furniture repair 
recommends using your original spring plate 
as a template for the location of the holes 
on the new replacement parts.  
 
Stack the original spring plate on top of the 
replacement spring plate.  Chair Care Patio 
furniture repair suggests using vice grips to 
hold the original and replacement plates 
together while drilling.
