2019 - 2020 Palm Springs Rattan Ownership Packet 
5/19/2020 
 
Introduction 
Since 1971, we have been designing and manufacturing comfortable, stylish furniture and 
accessories that are made to last. It is because of our policy of only using high quality materials, 
your Palm Springs Rattan® furniture will last and be easy to own. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Each piece of a Palm Springs Rattan® furniture is hand crafted one at a time.  Every element is 
individually crafted and fitted to the chair.  Hand woven wicker, artisan carved wood additions 
and leather-bound joints, add embellishments to each item making it a unique statement in 
your home. 
Hardware & Construction 
We build the products the exact same way whether they go into your home or into a hotel, and 
you can trust that you get the best quality every time.  Each piece is screwed together by skilled 
craftsman to ensure unrivaled longevity.  Joints are glued to prevent squeaking and every trim 
element is secured in place.   The leather bindings are not just wrapped in place; they are 
secured to the frame by adhesive on every contact surface. 
Material 
We visit our manufacturing partners annually to ensure that only “A” grade, sustainable 
material is used in each piece. 
Rattan 
A member of the palm family, rattan is a palm tree that grows like a vine up to 600 feet long in 
the jungles of the Far East.  Cut when it is seven to ten years old, the vine quickly replenishes itself. 
To read more about rattan, please refer to page 16, at the end of this ownership packet. 
Wicker 
Wicker is not a material, but a classification of furniture woven from any one of a variety of 
materials.  (i.e. rattan, reed, willow, buri, raffia, plastic, metal, or any other pliable material). 
Safety 
We, at Leader’s, take safety very seriously.  In our continuing effort to ensure that the experience with 
your new purchase is positive with regard to comfort, quality and design.  Please note the following 
important safety information, in addition to any other safety information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of damaged furniture can 
result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if unaddressed can become major repair and service issues that can 
create potential safety issues.  Contact the Leader’s Casual Furniture® Solutions Center for support at
