Rattan Wiki 
The first use of rattan as a raw material for furniture would be difficult to set, but it is reasonable to 
assume it began with the natives of the Asian countries where the vine grows so profusely.  The wide 
variety of species, the pliable nature of the wood, its toughness, and its workability provided early 
craftsmen with raw materials for a wide variety of uses including furniture. 
Rattan is not an ordinary material – 
far from it.  It has been called exotic 
and indeed it is for it has qualities 
that cannot be imitated by any 
other material.  It appears to be a 
vine but in reality, is a palm.  It has 
great variety in natural form yet an 
inherent 
consistency of 
basic 
characteristics.  It is flexible but 
extremely tough.  It can be formed 
into intricate shapes without loss of 
its 
exceptional 
strength. 
 
Its 
products are enjoyed in the most modern and sophisticated homes, yet its 
origins go back to primitive times and it can be made into the most beautiful 
and distinctive furniture. 
 
The production of rattan into home furnishings starts its long journey to the living rooms of the world as 
a sprout deep in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia where it grows profusely in moist swampy 
areas.  There are a number of different species with a mature stem diameter ranging from 1/8 – inch to 
more than 2 – inches and with lengths from a few feet to several hundreds of feet.  As the forests of the 
world are destroyed by illegal logging and slash and burn technique, rattan production has begun to shift 
to plantations.  There are approximately 852 square miles of rattan plantations in Asian countries.  In 
Indonesia approximately 4,200 households engage in rattan harvesting and production, spread across 
South Kalimantan, Cirebon, and Central Sulawesi.  In the 
Philippines more than 4,000 workers engage in the 
production of rattan furniture and handicraft.  Income 
received from weaving rattan is 75% higher than 
income received from farming.
