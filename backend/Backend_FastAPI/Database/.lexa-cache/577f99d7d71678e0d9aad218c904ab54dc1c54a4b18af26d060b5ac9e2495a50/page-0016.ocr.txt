What is the difference in Wicker & Rattan? 
Most people use the word “wicker” or “rattan” to describe our style of tropical furniture 
interchangeably.  Many of our designs incorporate both wicker & rattan features.  Rattan looks like a 
single pole and is the actual vine that was harvested.  Wicker simply means anything woven and refers 
to the more detailed décor on a piece of furniture. Wicker can be made from small rattan poles, vines, 
resin or even metal. 
Why is Rattan good for furniture making? 
The internal structure of a rattan pole is stringy, much like a celery stalk and when dried into shape it 
forms a structure that is lightweight, durable and slightly flexible, but incredibly strong; perfect to 
sustain the weight and wear needed for furniture.  It is so strong in fact it is often used in making 
weapons for martial arts.  Much like wood it will accept paints and stains desirable for home decorating. 
Are Rattan and Bamboo the same thing? 
Rattan and bamboo look similar but are distinctly different.  A simple way to tell if something is made 
from bamboo or rattan is to see whether there is a curve in the pole.  Bamboo is harder than mahogany 
and cannot be bent.  Rattan is durable yet flexible, allowing it to bend.
