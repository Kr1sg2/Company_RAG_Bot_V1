HIGH ELEVATION INSTALLATION 
This appliance is listed for elevations from 0-4500 feet in Canada and the U.S.  If elevation exceeds 4500 
feet it may be necessary to decrease the input rating by changing the existing burner orifice to a smaller 
size.  Input should be reduced 4% for each 1000 feet beyond the 4500 feet above sea level. Check with 
your local gas utility for assistance in determining the proper orifice in your location.  In some cases the  
heating value may already be reduced and downsizing the orifice may not be necessary.

“portable” propane tanks of less than 20-lb CAPACITY, Propane tanks commonly used with 
portable liquid propane gas grills.
