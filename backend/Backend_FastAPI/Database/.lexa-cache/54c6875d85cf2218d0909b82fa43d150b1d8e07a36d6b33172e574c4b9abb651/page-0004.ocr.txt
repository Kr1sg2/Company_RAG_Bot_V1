2.91.3 Central Cushion 
4/7/2018 
 
Rush Program: 
 
Central Cushion’s rush program allows us to guarantee delivery of the cushions in 7 calendar 
days. We can only use the stocking fabric selections, standard or elite, for this program.  
 
We are not able to utilize this on the following: 
o PFIT orders 
o Fabrics from the Sunbrella® kiosk 
o Upholstered product from PALU or PSRU 
 
Cost is $15.00 per cushion. So if the rush is for a sofa cushion, that has a set of 6 cushions, the 
cost would be $90.00
