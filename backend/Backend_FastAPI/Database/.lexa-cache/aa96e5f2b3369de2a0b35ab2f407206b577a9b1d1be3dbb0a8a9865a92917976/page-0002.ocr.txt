What is a Base SKU? 
One of Leaders competitive advantages is high choice meaning a large number of options.  This 
give the customer the ability to get exactly what they want.  NetSuite product data base is built 
with base Skus and options to make product easily configurable It is important to understand 
what a base SKU is to save confusion and not make mistakes.   
Letâ€™s use the Madeira Dining chair as an example 
 
 
The same chair can come in several frame finishes and several fabrics.  It always starts with the 
same base SKU.   
IMPORTANT:  A BASE SKU CAN BE ADDED TO AN INVOICE IN ERROR.  FURNITURE ITEMS 
SHOULD HAVE OPTIONS.  IF YOU SEE NO OPTION ON YOUR SKU OR THE PRICE IS 
ZERO THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU ADDED A BASE SKU BY MISTAKE.  KEEP 
YOUR EYES PEELED.  IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, WE GOT YOUR BACK.  PURCHASING 
IS ON THE LOOK OUT AND WILL LET YOU KNOW.
