Introduction 
Since 1971 we have been designing and manufacturing comfortable outdoor living products, made to last in the sun and by 
the sea.  We only use tested materials that are produced to live in harsh outdoor seaside conditions.  Because of our policy 
of only using high-quality materials, your Garden ClassicsÂ® furniture will be easy to own.  See the Cleaning and Care section 
in this ownership packet to get the most out of your investment. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Handwoven wicker, artisan carved original molds for cast aluminum, or the 25 step hand-finished process to make 
fiberglass, concrete, and aluminum look like wood, we put the time and effort into each piece to give it a look that 
will compliment your space. 
Materials 
 
We hand select the materials that go into each piece.  Structural frames are all powder-coated aluminum that will 
never rust.  Cast aluminum is made of high-quality alloy.  All hardware is 360 stainless steel or better.  Our UV 
stable synthetic wicker must pass a Tropical 4 year UV test and show no signs of change in color, surface texture, 
or strength.  
Construction 
 
We continuously learn and take steps to make our furniture better than any other outdoor furniture manufacturer.  
We use thicker aluminum in our frames, we pay more for materials with higher UV resistance, and we add 
reinforcement that will never be seen to the places that need it most.  All of our products are sold to restaurants 
and hotels with the exact same construction as the products we sell for your home.  Our goal is to make a product 
so durable that you have to give it away before you buy your next purchase.
