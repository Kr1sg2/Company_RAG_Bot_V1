Sun Fading 
It is an undeniable fact that everything will eventually discolor and fades in the sun. The sun is a 
powerful star that governs our planet and makes life possible. We cannot live without it but we can 
learn to live with it.  PoliSoul Timber™ is the best wood substitute developed to date. Not only is it 
very UV resistant it has the same color and graining throughout. This means that when it finally does 
fade it can be refreshed using a clean wire brush and rubbing the top surface off in the direction of 
the grain. Rest assured we have already UV tested PoliSoul Timber’s resistance to fading and 
discoloration in the sun. It past our 4 year equator test with flying colors (pun intended). To refresh 
your beautiful PoliSoul furniture follow these steps. 
 
1. Use a dust mask or other protection to avoid inhaling dust generated from this process 
2. With a firm grip on a large clean wire brush, with moderate pressure press down and stroke 
in the direction of the grain. 
3. Work an area larger than the spot to blend the texture you are creating. 
4. Stand back and adjust your viewing angle to make sure you have removed the affected area. 
Repeat step #2 till the concern is no longer noticeable 
5. Clean the area by sweeping a nylon brush in the direction of the grain 
6. It is recommended that you reapply Turtle Wax Ice to the entire table top to make it easier to 
clean
