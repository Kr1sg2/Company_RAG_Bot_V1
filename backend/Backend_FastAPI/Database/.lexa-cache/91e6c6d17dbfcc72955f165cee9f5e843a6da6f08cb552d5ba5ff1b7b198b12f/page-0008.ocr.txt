WASH
Washing is a vital step in keeping your product looking its best.  Washing removes loose contaminants from your surfaces.  If allowed to remain, contaminants can eventually 
bond to or etch your surfaces.  Household cleaners will strip off any protection you have applied.  Meguiar’s Marine Gel Wash is pH balanced, biodegradable to gently clean 
and preserve your surface protection.
CLEAN
While washing removes loose contaminants from surfaces, cleaning is intended to remove bonded surface contamination and attempt to remove below surface blemishes. 
Above surface contamination includes tree sap, environmental fallout, bug and bird droppings, and soiling.  Below surface defects include light scratches, water spots, and water 
etching.
PROTECT
The only way to keep your purchase looking great for as long as possible is to apply a protective coating to preserve the surface.  Meguiar’s protection formulas provide a durable 
protective layer that seals in the factory new look of your products, offers UV protection and keeps environmental elements from coming in direct contact with your surfaces.
MAINTAIN 
Frequent surface care makes maintenance easier.  The more frequently you care for your furniture, the easier the detailing process.  Maintenance is the frequent removal of 
contaminants before they get an opportunity to bond to or damage the surface.  Maintenance is designed to help you safely remove contaminants without stripping away your 
protective coatings, leaving your product looking polished and new.  
COVER
Covering your furniture puts a barrier between the elements and your purchase.  Covers block, rain, sun, and environmental contaminants like pollen and dust.  Be sure to use 
breathable covers in Florida that block rain and allow air to circulate.  Using non breathable covers like tarps or plastics trap moisture and promote mildew growth.
