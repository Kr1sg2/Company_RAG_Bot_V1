PoliSoul 
Congratulations on your new purchase. You made a great choice selecting furniture made with PoliSoul™ Timber. 
PoliSoul™ Timber has a grain that looks like Mother Nature created it, and it has no wood in it. I know it is hard to 
believe there is no wood in it with how beautiful it is and how it feels.  Since it is a fully synthetic product, it give you 
years of low maintenance service. 
 
 
Caution 
Do Not Place Hot Items On Surface 
Our beautiful PoliSoul™ Timber can be damaged by hot items. Care should be taken to protect the surface of the 
material from fire, sparks, hot containers, or open flame. Prolonged contact from a heat source can cause the surface to 
become shinny or melt and distort. 
Personal Protection 
When you perform maintenance and cleaning, always keep safety in mind. Protect your eyes and skin 
from chemicals by using eye protection, protective clothing, and gloves.  When using any type of 
cleaner, especially bleach, do so in a well-ventilated area.  
Regular Maintenance 
 Regular cleaning of PoliSoul Timber™ is easy. A wet dishtowel to wipe the surface down after each 
use is sufficient. We recommend the application of Meguiar’s Extreme Marine Rubber & Vynel 
Protector to give your beautiful new furniture added protection.  By applying Meguiar’s Extreme 
Marine Rubber & Vinyl Protector to your furniture it will make it even easier to maintain. 
Application is simple, spray and wipe.  Meguiar’s Extreme Marine Rubber & Vinyl Protector can be 
found in all Leaders Showrooms or purchased on leadersfurniture.com.  
 
 
 
Spills 
Even the hardest dried-on spills are simple to resolve. Most can be taken care of with a wet dishrag.  
Occasionally a little more effort is required. For best results, don’t spot clean.  Clean the entire 
area. It is important to note that the table must be fully dry before evaluating your efforts. Take 
the time to let the top completely dry before escalating your method. Follow the grid below:
