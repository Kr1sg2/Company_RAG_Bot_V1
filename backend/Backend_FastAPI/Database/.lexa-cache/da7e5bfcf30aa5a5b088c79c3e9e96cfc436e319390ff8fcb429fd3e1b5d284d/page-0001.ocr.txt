You are eligible to begin earning commissions under your own employee ID 
number, once you have answered the worksheets correctly, signed and 
submitted the last page of the Essentials Workbook. 
You are not required to wait for your 90-day probationary period to end in order 
to begin earning your commissions. 
Build relationships with your guests and create spaces, don’t just try to make a 
sale.  Nobody likes to be sold to but everybody likes to buy.
