What is a Browser Tab 
A browser tab allows you to open multiple web pages in a single browser to help prevent cluttering your 
desktop.  Mastering tabbed browsing will make you a more efficient computer user helping you to help 
guests faster and more efficiently, helping you to sell more. 
 
In this example there are three browser tabs 
 
Open In a New Window 
To maximize your efficiency, you can elect to open information in a new browser tab instead of losing 
your place and writing over the existing tab.   
Opening a New Browser Tab. 
To open a new browser tab, click the 
 next to the last tab in the browser.  This will give you new 
blank window to search for information or a website on the internet.   
 
 
Opening a Link in a New Browser Tab 
It is helpful to open a link in a new window so you can reference more than one thing at a time.  For 
instance, if you have a Customer Record open and you want to reference and item you can open the 
Product Look-Up link in a new window instead of navigating away from the Customer Record.  This can 
be done one of two ways 
Click the Scroll Wheel on the Mouse 
Most computer mice are equipped with a scroll wheel between the left 
and right buttons.  Simply scroll over the link you would like to open and 
click the scroll wheel.  The link will open in a new window.   
Right Click 
If your mouse does not have a scroll wheel you can right click the link and choose “Open in a new 
tab.”  Using this method, you can choose to “Open in a new Window” which will allow you to open 
the link in a completely new web browser.
