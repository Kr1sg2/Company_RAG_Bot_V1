with a 1:1 mixture of water and denatured alcohol. Spray it with a leather-
safe fungicide and allow it to dry thoroughly in the sun. 
Harder Surfaces 
Hard surfaces can withstand more intensive cleaning. Wear goggles, a 
mask and gloves to protect you from the mold. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter to remove surface mold. Mix water and a non-ammonia detergent 
together and scrub the entire surface. Use a non-abrasive scrubber to 
avoid damaging the wood finishes. Wipe the detergent mixture off. Mix 1/4 
cup bleach with 1 gallon of water and spray all surfaces. Leave the mixture 
on for at least 6 hours, and then move the furniture outside to dry in the sunlight.
