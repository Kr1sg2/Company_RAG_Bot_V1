In humid conditions, mold and mildew can thrive on leather, wood and 
upholstered furniture. Over time, these fungi can reduce the aesthetic value 
of furniture and give off an unpleasant, musty odor. Cleaning and 
preventing mold and mildew growth will eliminate these problems, as well 
as protect your family against harmful allergens. 
Consider the Source 
Examine your home to determine what factors are contributing to mold and 
mildew growth. If you have just taken the furniture out of storage, you can 
assume that being in an enclosed, damp space caused the mold growth. If, 
however, the furniture began to grow mold in your living space, you should 
examine the ceiling, windows and floorboards for cracks and leaks that 
might introduce moisture to your furniture. If necessary, hire a home repair 
service to fill in cracks and prevent future damage. 
Hot and Cold 
In some cases, mold and mildew can grow because air temperature is not 
uniform. When hot and cold air meets, they cause water particles to 
condense on furniture surfaces, contributing to mold and mildew growth. 
This problem is difficult to detect, so consider hiring a home ventilation 
expert to assess the temperature of your home and offer potential 
solutions. If you live in a humid climate, purchase a high-quality 
dehumidifier and plan to check your furniture for mold growth regularly in 
the future. 
Remove or Clean? 
Porous materials like upholstery and foam are more likely to retain mold 
particles. If your upholstery already has mold damage, throw it out to 
prevent future mold problems. Contact a reupholstering service if you wish 
to salvage a valuable wood or metal frame. Furniture made out of slightly 
porous materials like leather or wood usually retain their structural integrity 
and are only subject to superficial mold growth. Likewise, you can clean 
inorganic materials like plastic and metal with little effort. 
Leather Furniture 
Cleaning mold and mildew from leather furniture will release spores and 
other particles into the air, so it's best to take furniture outside on a dry, 
sunny day before cleaning it. Be sure to wear eye protection, gloves and a 
facemask to protect yourself from allergens while you clean. Use a stiff, 
plastic brush to scrape off any visible surface mold. Wipe the leather down
