How do I adjust my timer? 
Most stores are on an Intermatic timer. Below is a description of the parts that make up the timer and 
how to adjust it properly.  If you have a different timer that has push pins and you do not understand 
how to operate it, please ask.  Please make sure your electric terminals are safely covered. If you see 
that the electric insulators are exposed please let sales.leadership@leadersfurniture.com know 
immediately so a repair can be scheduled.
