REQUIRED FOR ASSEMBLY:
• 400 lbs. playground sand (not included).
IMPORTANT:Prior to assembly it is important to decide on the location of the AKZ13
umbrella. The umbrella measures approximately 10 ft. in height and 13 ft. in width. 
• Allow ample height to avoid damage to your umbrella during assembly and usage. 
• Choose a location that is level and sturdy. 
• Avoid any sloping or soft ground. 
• Consider a location that will maximize the umbrella’s rotating swivel function. Placing
the AKZ13 between two entertaining areas is ideal.
NOTE: Some parts may be included in the styrofoam packaging. 
DO NOT discard any packaging or box until assembly is complete.
