Survey 
 
Want to know how we are doing?  DispatchTrack sends out a digital survey to each guest.  Click 
on the Survey button to get a summary of how we are doing.   
Reviewing Pictures 
 
One of the most powerful tools for the selling teams is the ability to review pictures.  You can 
review a picture from the home screen for the selected day by simply floating your cursor over 
the 
  icon.  You can click this icon to view more than one picture.  You can go right into the 
customers home to see the spaces you have created.  Did you make a designed space to live in 
or did your just sell a place to sit? 
Reviewing Driver Team Comments 
 
Similar to reviewing pictures, you can float your cursor over the 
 icon to view any notes the 
driver team has entered.  You will have this option for the route summary or the customer 
record.
