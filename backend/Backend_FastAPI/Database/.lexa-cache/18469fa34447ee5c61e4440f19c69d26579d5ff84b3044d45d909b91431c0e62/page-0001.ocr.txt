401(k) 
The Leader’s Casual Furniture® 401(k) retirement plan is available to all Leader’s Holding 
Company™ employees after 60 days of continued employment.  For your convenience you will 
automatically be enrolled at 3% of your earnings the first of the month after you meet eligibility. 
Why should I participate in 401(k)? 
Social Security will not be enough to retire on.  It is only meant as a supplement to other retirement 
income.  The responsibility for obtaining sufficient retirement income is yours.  A 401(k) is a sound and 
great way to start. 
Investing Early Pays Off… 
 
You can invest a percentage of your pay in a 401(k) retirement account.  In addition to your 
contribution to your retirement savings Leader’s Casual Furniture® traditionally matches a percentage 
of what you invest personally.  This percentage contribution from Leader’s Casual Furniture® is 
determined annually at the end of the year. Contact the HR Office for more information.
