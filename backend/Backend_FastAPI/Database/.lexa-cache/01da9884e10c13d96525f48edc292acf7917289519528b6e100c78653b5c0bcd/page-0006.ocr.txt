Notice for contract installations:  
Contract Installation Notice 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Such inspections 
must include all products of a like kind and model, not merely a random sampling within model categories or 
among like products. 
In addition to the periodic inspections of all products, regular random sampling inspections within model categories and among like 
products must be undertaken.  
The property should keep a log of each full inspection and random sample inspection, including the date, time, and images taken 
during the inspection with the inspector's signature, to ensure inspection compliance and ensure the best effort to maintain a safe 
space for guests. 
Include the following or substantially similar conspicuous written notice as part of the posted Rules and Regulations at poolside and 
elsewhere wherever chaise lounges and recliners are available for use:  
o 
"Never adjust chaise lounge or recliner headrests while seated.  Serious finger, hand or other bodily injury may result from 
adjusting headrest while seated."  
o 
"During windy conditions, the use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be discontinued and users should leave the 
area."  
Consider also including such notice in the written material(s) provided to guests in connection with the availability and use of the 
guest amenities at your facility.
