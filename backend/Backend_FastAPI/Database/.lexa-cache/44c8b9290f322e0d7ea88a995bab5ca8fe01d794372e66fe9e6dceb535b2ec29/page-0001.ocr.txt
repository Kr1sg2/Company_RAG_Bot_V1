Online Testimonial Loading 
Leader’s gets hundreds of great testimonials a month.  Of all of the customer comments that come to 
the warehouse 99% are satisfied.  We need to let people know this by asking our customers to load their 
experience on the internet searches so people can have confidence in Leader’s.  This helps them decide 
to come to your store.  We are asking each store to be responsible for your location.  We will give each 
customer that brings proof that they loaded their great, good, bad or indifferent Leader’s experience on 
a third party website for 50% off any accessory.  A testimonial loaded on the Leader’s site does not 
count and will not qualify for the discount.  If a customer does not have the internet please suggest that 
they use the public library to load their experience and qualify for the discount.
