Stone Top Care 
All of our stone products come sealed.  The sealer will wear out over time, making the surface harder to 
maintain and allowing staining.  Spills should be wiped up immediately.  Acidic liquids like juice and wine 
can etch the surface if allowed to remain on the surface. 
Daily Cleaning 
Stone tops can be regularly maintained using the same products used on a stone countertop. 
Daily Granite cleaner for a quick surface cleaning. 
Sealing 
Use any granite sealer that you can find at a home improvement center.  Please follow the instructions 
on the bottle.  It is usually as easy as spray and wipe.     
Wear Items 
The parts that create the comfort in swivel, gliding, and rocking furniture are wear items that must be 
replaced from time to time.  If you are handy with a wrench, the maintenance can be easily done at 
home.  Leaders can provide full service for a fee if requested.   
Spring Plates 
If your favorite chair starts to feel loose and leans back to far it is time to replace the spring plates.  
Spring plates are not covered under warranty.  Leaders always keeps stock and can cut and make the 
specific plate you need for any manufacturer.  Installing new spring plates is easy.   
Remove the Old Plates 
1. Before beginning talk a picture of your chair for reference. 
2. Remove the spring plates from your chair.  You will need to wrenches, one to hold the 
bolt and the other to spin the nut.  
 
It is essential to keep all original hardware removed from your chair as they will be needed to 
install the new spring plates.
