Windy Conditions 
Safety Warning!  During windy conditions, chaise lounge and recliner headrests 
may be blown forward, possibly resulting in head, neck, facial, arm and/or back 
injuries.  During windy conditions, the headrests must be lowered to the fully 
down position.  The use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be discontinued 
and users should leave the area.  
Contract Installation Notice 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Such inspections 
must include all products of a like kind and model, not merely a random sampling within model 
categories or among like products. 
In addition to the periodic inspections of all products, regular random sampling inspections within 
model categories and among like products must be undertaken.  
The property should keep a log of each full inspection and random sample inspection, including the 
date, time, and images taken during the inspection with the inspector's signature, to ensure inspection 
compliance and ensure the best effort to maintain a safe space for guests. 
Include the following or substantially similar conspicuous written notice as part of the posted Rules and 
Regulations at poolside and elsewhere wherever chaise lounges and recliners are available for use:  
1. "Never adjust chaise lounge or recliner headrests while seated.  Serious finger, hand or other 
bodily injury may result from adjusting headrest while seated."  
2. "During windy conditions, the use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be discontinued and 
users should leave the area."  
Consider also including such notice in the written material(s) provided to guests in connection with the 
availability and use of the guest amenities at your facility.
