2024 Garden Classics Ownership Packet 
6/17/2024 
Introduction 
Florida Family Owned Since 1971, Garden Classics™ has been designing and manufacturing comfortable 
outdoor living products that last in the sun and by the sea.  We only use tested materials that are 
produced to withstand harsh outdoor seaside conditions.  Because of our policy of only using high-
quality materials, your Garden Classics™ furniture will be easy to own.  See the Cleaning and Care 
section in this ownership packet to get the most out of your investment. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Hand-woven wicker, artisan carved original molds for cast aluminum, or the 25 step hand-
finished process to make fiberglass, concrete, and aluminum look like wood, we put the time 
and effort into each piece to give it a look that will complement your space. 
Materials 
 
We hand-pick the materials that go into each piece.  Structural frames are all powder-coated 
aluminum that will never rust.  Cast aluminum is made of high-quality alloy.  All hardware is 360 
stainless steel or better.  Our UV-stable synthetic wicker must pass a Tropical 4-year UV test and 
show no signs of change in color, surface texture, or strength.  
Construction 
 
We continuously learn and take steps to make our furniture better than any other outdoor 
furniture manufacturer.  We use thicker aluminum in our frames, pay more for materials with 
higher UV resistance, and add reinforcement that will never be seen to the places that need it 
most.  Our products are sold to restaurants and hotels with the same construction as the 
products we sell for your home.  Our goal is to make a product so durable that you must give it 
away before buying your next purchase.
