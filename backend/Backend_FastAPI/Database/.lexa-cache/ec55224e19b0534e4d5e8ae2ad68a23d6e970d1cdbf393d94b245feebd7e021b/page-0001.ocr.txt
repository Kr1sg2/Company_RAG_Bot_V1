Merchandising Plans/2020_11 Furniture Covers 
Why merchandise to the plan?  Accessories & Add-On items complete our 
presentation to the customer, increase foot traffic in our stores, create repeat 
customers and & increase our average sale.  We are doing ourselves and our 
customers a disservice if we don’t present the product in the best way possible, 
merchandising like items and pairing styles together appropriately to maximize our 
selling opportunity and enhance the customer’s experience. 
What did we buy?  Furniture Covers in two different styles, special orders availability with each. 
Why did we buy?  To provide a good and better option of furniture cover, including different features with 
competitive price points  
How should I Show?  Furniture Cover Bags will be neatly displayed in provided plastic tote.  Signage will follow 
with further instructions.  
1. Place tote lid on the bottom of your Kokomo Wicker Trunk (GARD-6085,###) 
2. Open the Ravenna Cushion and Cover Storage Bag (COVR-55-180) 
3. Insert the storage tote (without lid) inside of the Storage Bag, bring up the sides of the bag to fully cover 
the storage 
4. Re-position the Leader’s tag on each cover to the top short side of plastic bag of each cover before filing 
the covers inside of the tote, label side up 
5. Place all Ravenna covers on the left and all Terrazzo covers on the right.  This will match the signage that 
will affix to the Trunk Lid 
6. Remove one Ravenna Lounge Chair Cover (COVR-55-160) and one Terrazzo Lounge Chair Cover (COVR-
59942) from the outer packaging, fold neatly with straps and elastic visible.  We will mark these out of 
inventory to be used as samples to show and demonstrate with customers.  
a. Place the Ravenna Lounge Chair Sample on the Left Side 
b. Place the Terrazzo Lounge Chair Sample on the Right Side 
7. Zip up your Cushion Storage Bag, close the trunk lid and place POP Easel on top of Trunk 
8. Once Signage arrives for the Trunk Lid, we will revise the plan and send signage instructions.
