• Make sure that the down button on the remote brings the awning out (the down button 
points to the LED light). If not, the direction of operation on the motor needs to be 
reversed and the wind sensor re-programmed. Test the awning by pushing up on the 
front bar for 12 seconds. The awning should retract.                                                                  
        
        
• Check the batteries. The red indicator light will blink when the batteries are properly 
installed and when the program button is pressed.  
          
 
• The wind sensor needs to be connected to its mounting bracket for it to function. 
Check to make sure the round silver magnet in attached to the mounting bracket. Use a 
silicone base glue to refasten it if necessary.  
 
                                                                                
 
• Try resetting the motor by unplugging if for 5 seconds and immediately plugging it 
back in. Test the awning.  
                                                                
 
\ 
• Reprogram the wind sensor to the motor by pressing the program button on the back 
of the remote and then the program button on the wind sensor. Test the awning. 
 
• If the awning retracts every ½ hour, it means the batteries are low. Every hour means 
the batteries are dead or the unit is off its mount.
