Limited Lifetime Warranty 
 
Classic Accessories warrants this product will be free of defects in materials and construction for its life from the date of purchase.  This warranty 
applies only to the original purchaser who thereafter uses the product for personal use only.  This warranty no longer applies after any resale of the 
product, whether new or used. 
 
Exclusions.  This warranty does not cover ordinary wear and tear, fabric fading, mold and/or mildew; damage that occurs from high winds, extreme 
weather, acts of nature, or pooling water; damage caused by sharp areas or protrusions such as (but not limited to) corners of grills, furniture, 
appliances and equipment, rain and gutter spouts, ladders, antennas; damage caused by animals, rodents and insects; damage that occurs during 
shipping; damage resulting from improper package opening, installation, handling, maintenance or storage; or damage due to accident, misuse, 
abuse, vandalism, neglect or exposure to petroleum products or caustic chemicals.  Products purchased used, open box or as-is that are damaged 
and/or missing parts are excluded from warranty. Failure to follow product instructions, product alterations, or use of a non-trailerable product 
while being transported on a non-enclosed truck or trailer will void this warranty.  Use of a trailerable product that is being transported on a non-
enclosed truck or trailer is covered only if the cover is properly installed and all provided attachments are used. For pontoon boats and float tubes, 
this warranty does not apply to commercial use or cover lost parts, abrasion or damages caused by improper inflation; exposure to saltwater will 
void this warranty.

within a reasonable period of time, one of the following: A) replacement of the product with an identical one, B) replacement with a similar 
product that may not match the original, or C) repair of the product, as deemed appropriate, at no cost to you. Contact Classic Accessories at

product tag (see Figure A) will be required to make a warranty claim. Photos may be requested to be sent to us.  We may request that you ship the 
product back to us.  If required to return the product to Classic Accessories, you are responsible for the initial shipping charges. THE REMEDY 
SELECTED BY CLASSIC ACCESSORIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE AND SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF 
WARRANTY. 
 
Disclaimer of other warranties. This limited lifetime warranty is the exclusive warranty given by Classic Accessories. It supersedes any prior, 
contrary or additional representations, whether oral or written. No person, including agents and employees of Classic Accessories, is authorized to 
give any further representation or warranty or assume any further obligations on behalf of Classic Accessories, whether orally or in writing.   Any 
implied warranties, including any WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY or WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, are limited to the 
duration of the limited lifetime warranty given above. Some states or countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so 
the above limitation may not apply to you. Classic Accessories expressly disclaims any and all liability for personal injury, property damage or 
loss, whether direct, indirect, or incidental arising out of or connected with the use, misuse or neglect of this product.  
 
 
EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.  CLASSIC ACCESSORIES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR 
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES whatsoever arising out of or connected with the use, misuse or 
inability to use this product, or arising out of any nonconformity or defect in the product, or defect in any service 
provided under the limited lifetime warranty.  This exclusion applies even if Classic Accessories has been advised of 
the possibility of such damages and/or if the above warranty fails in its essential purpose and regardless of whether 
such damages are sought for breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence or strict liability or tort or under any 
legal theory. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of consequential or incidental damages, so the 
above limitation may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other 
rights which vary from state to state and country to country.
