*Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years. If your cushions are made by fabric from one of these mills and the mill finds the 
fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make the new covers for your cushions. If you would like completely new 
cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade.
