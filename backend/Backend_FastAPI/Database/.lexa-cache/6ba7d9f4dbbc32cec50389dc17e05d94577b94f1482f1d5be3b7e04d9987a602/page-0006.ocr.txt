Cleaning - Preventative Maintenance 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to clean does not 
mean that it will not get dirty in an outdoor environment.  A little preventative maintenance goes a long way when 
it comes to keeping your new furnishings looking newer, for longer regular periodic care of your outdoor furniture 
will help maintain its appearance and functionality better than occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider the 
specific conditions and usage to which your product is exposed, so appropriate maintenance can be provided.   
 
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. Regular cleaning of outdoor furniture will 
help to prevent its forming.  Do not place flowerpots or any items on the furniture that will leave stains.  Do not 
place hot items directly onto furniture to avoid melting. 
 
Covers 
  Covers can be purchased for at a great price, for any size furniture or table, including sectionals and fire 
pits.  Using good quality, weather proof, breathable covers to cover your purchase while you are out of 
town, while the leaves are dropping, through pollen season, or through seasonal rains will not only 
reduce the amount of cleaning you have to do to keep your furniture looking new, it will also reduce 
your use and exposure to cleaning agents.  Please send us an e-mail if we can help you with purchasing 
or information about covers at solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com.
