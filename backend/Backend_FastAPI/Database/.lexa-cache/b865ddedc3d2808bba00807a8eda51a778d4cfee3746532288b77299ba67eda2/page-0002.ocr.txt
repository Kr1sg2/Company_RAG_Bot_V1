Company Overview:   
Since 1984, Treasure Garden has built a reputation of leadership by producing top quality, custom-
made, handcrafted umbrellas. Combining advanced technology with the latest color and fabric trends, 
we continue to enhance our products and their performance every year. We are committed to 
providing the largest and most innovative selection of shade solutions to suit all your needs and 
include umbrella lighting and furniture cover protection. 
Our founder, Oliver Ma began his manufacturing experience at an early age by apprenticing and 
mastering the craft of umbrella construction. His uncompromising attention to detail and strong work 
ethic laid the groundwork for the successful formation of Treasure Garden. 
This has been the hallmark for Treasure Garden – consistently designing, testing and bringing new 
innovations to the shade industry. This attribute ensures greater brand life-cycle management and 
maintains our market growth. 
We have always offered innovation, quality, and value, but unlike other manufacturers, Treasure 
Garden is a Vertically Integrated Manufacturer, ensuring a more balanced work-flow. This enables 
Treasure Garden the flexibility to respond quickly to market demands. 
The 3,500 employees who share in the same vision on a daily basis, and their uncompromising 
attention to detail enables Treasure Garden to continue to be the largest shade products manufacturer 
in the world. 
We manufacture and produce over 90% of the components used in our products from their raw state. 
This allows Treasure Garden the advantage of monitoring every stage of the manufacturing process 
and maintains a consistent level of quality.
