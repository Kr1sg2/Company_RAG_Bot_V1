Timeline for Improvement, Consequences & Expectations: 
Effective immediately, you are placed on a 30-day PIP.  You will be expected to make regular progress on the plan 
outlined above.  Failure to meet or exceed these expectations, or any display of gross misconduct will result in 
further disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  In addition, if there is no significant improvement to 
indicate that the expectations and goals will be met within the timeline indicated in this PIP, your employment 
may be terminated prior to 30-days.  Furthermore, failure to maintain performance expectations after the 
completion of the PIP may result in additional disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
 
The PIP does not alter the employment-at-will relationship. Additionally, the contents of this PIP are to remain 
confidential.  Should you have questions or concerns regarding the content, you will be expected to follow up 
directly with your manager.
