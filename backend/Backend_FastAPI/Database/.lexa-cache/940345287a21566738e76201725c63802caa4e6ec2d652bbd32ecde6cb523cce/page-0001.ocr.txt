original purchase date. Glen Raven will provide replacement 
fabric at no cost during years one through eight; at the then-
current selling price less a 15% discount during the ninth year; 
and less a 30% discount during the tenth year.
THIS WARRANTY COVERS
This warranty applies to the original purchaser of Sunbrella fabric and protects against 
Sunbrella fabric becoming unserviceable due to color or strength loss from normal 
usage and exposure conditions, including sunlight, mildew and atmospheric chemicals.
This warranty covers Sunbrella fabric only. This warranty does not cover normal care and cleaning; damage 
from misuse or abuse; improper installation; or costs associated with replacement of the fabric, including labor 
and installation. Glen Raven’s liability is expressly limited to this warranty. Glen Raven reserves the right to 
inspect the fabric submitted for claim. Glen Raven will supply new equivalent fabric to replace the fabric that 
becomes unserviceable.
Sunbrella limited warranty. We stand behind our fabrics with a guarantee that’s 
the best in the industry: a 5-year limited warranty for upholstery, specialty fabrics and 
decorative shade fabrics and a 10-year limited warranty for shade and marine fabrics.
