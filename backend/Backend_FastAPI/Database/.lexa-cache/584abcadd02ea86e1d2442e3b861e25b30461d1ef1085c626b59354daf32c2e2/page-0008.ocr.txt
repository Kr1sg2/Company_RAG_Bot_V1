How 
Periodically 
every year 
after 
ownership 
At least 
once per 
year per 
customer

than following up with them at least 
once per year.   
Email templated, post card or 
phone call.  Ask them if we can 
help in anyway with their previous 
purchase.  Suggest care and 
maintenance, covers, and let them 
know we offer replacement 
cushions for any of our in house 
brands.  Be sure to know the price 
of the suggested items when you 
communicate with the customer.
