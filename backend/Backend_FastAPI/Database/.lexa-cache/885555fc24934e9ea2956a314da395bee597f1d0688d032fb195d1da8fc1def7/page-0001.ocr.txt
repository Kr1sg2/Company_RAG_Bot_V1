General I.T. Tips & Trouble Shooting 
There are many different things that could cause a concern with your computer.  Most of the time, concerns can be 
fixed using simple troubleshooting techniques, like closing and reopening the program. It's important to try these simple 
solutions before giving up on your own abilities. No matter what's causing the issue, troubleshooting will always be a 
process of trial and errorâ€”in some cases, you may need to use several different approaches before you can find a 
solution; other problems may be easy to fix.  The I.T. team uses the following steps that you can try to when attempting 
to resolve a concern. 
1. Close and Reopen the Program 
Before you consider your system broken, please close the program you are experiencing the 
concern in and reopen it.  If the concern persists please go to step 2. 
2. Restart the computer 
When all else fails, restarting the computer is a good thing to try. This can solve a lot of basic 
issues you may experience with your computer. 
3. Always check the cables 
If you're having trouble with a specific piece of computer hardware, such as your monitor or 
keyboard, an easy first step is to check all related cables to make sure they're properly 
connected. 
4. Write down your steps 
Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to write down each step you take. This way, 
you'll be able to remember exactly what you've done and can avoid repeating the same 
mistakes. If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly 
what you've tried already. 
5. Take notes about error messages 
If your computer gives you an error message, be sure to take a picture, screen shot or write down as much 
information as possible about the error message. You may be able to use this information later to find out if 
other people are having the same error.
