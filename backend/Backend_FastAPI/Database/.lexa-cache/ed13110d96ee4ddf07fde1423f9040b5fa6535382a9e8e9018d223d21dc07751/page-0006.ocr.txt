2/27/2024 
 
Solution Center Team Member Commission 
Solution Center Team members are paid at an hourly rate and are not eligible for Sales Contests.  Sales 
generated out of the Solutions Center by a Solutions Center Team member do qualify for commission for 
the team member. 
Pulling/Losing Commissions 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® understands that mistakes will be made from time to time.  During your first 
90 days we will work with you - train and forgive errors while you get up to speed.  After that, it is 
reasonable to expect a sales team member should have an accurate understanding of a policy or 
procedure.  When a sales team member is repeating the same mistake after coaching and training, it 
may be necessary for the sales team member to share in the cost incurred from the error by losing 
commission on a sale.  Some examples of when this will occur after your first 90 days: 
✓ Balances are not collected on an invoice and items have been delivered 
✓ Sales Tax is not collected on an invoice 
✓ If Finance does not cover the balance of a customer’s account and no other method of payment 
has been collected to cover the full balance 
✓ If a customer is misquoted or under charged 
✓ Wrong product is special ordered and new product must be reordered 
✓ Sales are canceled and rewritten to qualify for sales contests 
✓ Free delivery on sales types that include “Delivery on a Leader’s Truck” without prior knowledge 
of Sales Leadership 
✓ Selling non-qualified Contract & Designer Sales
