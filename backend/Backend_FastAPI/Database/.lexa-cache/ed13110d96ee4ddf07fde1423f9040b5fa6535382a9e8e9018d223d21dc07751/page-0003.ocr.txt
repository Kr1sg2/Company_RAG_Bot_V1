Commission 
Commission pay can be very exciting!  A job that has commission as part of its pay allows you to make 
your own opportunity for income.  The harder you work, the more you learn, the more passion you put 
into your presentation, the more you will earn.  If you focus on the customer and trying to solve their 
needs rather than sell them, you will have a fun successful career on commission sales.
