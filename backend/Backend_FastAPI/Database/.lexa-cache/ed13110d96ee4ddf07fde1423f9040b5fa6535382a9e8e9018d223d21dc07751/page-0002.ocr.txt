Pay Rates & Schedule 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® has a bi-weekly pay schedule.  You will receive a paycheck (either direct 
deposit or via pay card) every other week.  Commission Reports are run weekly and then combined at 
the end of the two week pay period.  Pay periods begin on a Monday and end on a Sunday & are paid 
out on the Thursday following the end of a pay period. 
Commission is only paid on invoices that have been delivery updated.  Leader’s Casual Furniture® does 
not pay commission on written sales.  Invoices delivered during a pay period will be a part of the 
respective pay periods’ paycheck.  It is imperative that you maintain your open orders to be sure that 
invoices are updated for merchandise received by the customer.  This includes at home deliveries, 
merchandise shipped out of a Leader’s delivery zone, customer pick-ups, etc. 
Commission pays by line item on the invoice.
