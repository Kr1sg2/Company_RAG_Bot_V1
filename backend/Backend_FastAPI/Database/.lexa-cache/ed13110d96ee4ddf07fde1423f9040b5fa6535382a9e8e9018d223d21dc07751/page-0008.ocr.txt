Sales Contests 
Sales contests are a great way to increase your pay as well as your knowledge and ability to sell a wide 
range of Leader’s products and services. Sales contests vary in length and the spiff is determined by sales 
management and the partnering vendor, if any. Any current part time or full-time employee at the end of 
the contest period will be paid the spiff earned for that contest. 
 
 
✓ Sales Contests do not pay immediately after closing. The contest winnings are awarded after 
final calculations have been reviewed and the funds are received from the entity sponsoring 
the event. 
✓ Contests sponsored by Leader’s: 
• 
Awards will be included in your normal pay checks and all applicable taxes, benefits 
and garnishments will be deducted. 
✓ Contests sponsored by vendors: 
• 
Vendors will choose their own method of distributing winnings. 
• 
Earnings from contests that are not included in your regular paycheck have not been 
taxed, garnished nor had benefits deducted. It is the team member’s responsibility to 
claim these earnings appropriately at the end of every tax year. 
✓ Past employees who were employed at the end of the contest will be paid earned awards.
