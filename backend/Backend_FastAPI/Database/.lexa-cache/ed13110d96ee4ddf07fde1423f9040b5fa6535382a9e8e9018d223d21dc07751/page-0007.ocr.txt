Covering Another Location Pay 
Covering another location should be an exciting time where one gets to further their skills, interact with 
other team members within the company and build professional relationships.  In order to keep the 
focus on all these positive aspects, for team members that attend ongoing training or assist in covering 
another location, additional compensation will be offered to ensure financial stability.  This is a lump 
sum payment that is based on actual clock-in and clock-out times that is paid as a commission payment 
(this does not go toward overtime or the PTO rate calculation). 
Additional Compensation:  Team Members will receive all commissions earned while making sales at the 
coverage location.  Team Members have the option to be paid mileage or drive time to the location they 
are covering.  The Team Member will be paid for one or the other, not both.  The mileage 
reimbursement policy applies. 
Team members who have completed 90 days of employment who cover a location they are not 
normally assigned to will receive the store coverage pay for each day they are away from their location. 
Please note that the mandatory sales and managers’ action committee meetings do not qualify for 
this program.

Add On Sales 
You have the most opportunity to add value to your customer’s experience and to put money in your 
pocket by selling Delivery, Fabric Protection, & Fabric Protection Plus. 
Delivery not only guarantees that the product will arrive at the customer’s home un-damaged and set 
up by our Delivery Specialists, but also saves you and the customer the hassle of transporting the goods 
to your store and then to the customer’s home when they pick it up.  This is time consuming and 
exposes the goods to more opportunity for damage.
