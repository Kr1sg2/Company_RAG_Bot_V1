Parts & Custom Items 
Item is Not in the Configurator 
Place Holder SKUs 
 
The item configurator is an amazing tool that will allow you to order almost everything manufacturers 
have available. For information on the Product Configurator see 3.1 Writing a Sales / Product 
Configurator.  
 
Parts, custom configurations, or one of a kind items may not be able to be ordered using the 
configurator.  If you cannot configure an item, please use the correct place holder SKU by brand below. 
 
Note:   
If you see an error in the data in the configurator, and it is preventing you from ordering the item you 
would like, please communicate it to the purchasing team.  The Purchasing Team maintains the 
configurator data to give the sales team the ability to write transactions faster and more accurately.   
One team, One Goal!
