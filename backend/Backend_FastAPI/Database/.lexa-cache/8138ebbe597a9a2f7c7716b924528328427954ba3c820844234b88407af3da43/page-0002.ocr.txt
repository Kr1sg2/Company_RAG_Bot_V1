How do I use a Place Holder SKU? 
1. Try to use the configurator to order the item by clicking the 
 button and 
following the prompts. 
a. Check that the following are correct: 
i. Manufacturer 
ii. Collection 
iii. Keyword   
2. If you cannot configure the items in the configurator, in a Sales Order, on the Items Tab, type 
the appropriate Place Holder SKU from the list above into the item field. 
3. Follow the instruction in the Descriptions field 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE 
THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION.  CHANGING THE DESCRIPTION OF AN ITEM ORDERED USING THE 
CONFIGURATOR WILL NOT CHANGE WHAT IS ORDERED.  CHANGING THE DESCRIPTION AND 
GETTING A RESULT IS EXCLUSIVE TO PLACE HOLDER SKUS
