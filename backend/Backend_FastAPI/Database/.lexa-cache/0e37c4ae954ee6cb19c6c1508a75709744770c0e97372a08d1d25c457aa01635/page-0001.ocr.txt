OUTDURA FABRICS
CLEAN & CARE
CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS FOR NORMAL STAINS
Remove any loose dirt. Prepare a mixture of cold to lukewarm 
water (do not exceed 100Â° F) and mild soap. Rub in mixture 
with a soft brush and allow the mixture to thoroughly soak into 
the fabric. Rinse well with water and air dry. Do not machine 
dry.
CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUBBORN STAINS
Remove as much surface dirt as possible. Soak fabric for 
1 hour in a mixture of 1 gallon cold water, 1/2 cup bleach, 
and 1/2 cup mild soap.
Rub in mixture with a soft brush and rinse thoroughly with 
cold to lukewarm water and air-dry. Never use water over 
100 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not machine dry. Detergents 
can be used on Outdura without harm; however, it may 
remove some of the water and stain resistant properties. 
If this is important to you, a simple spraying of a post cure 
fluorocarbon will restore these properties. Please follow 
the instructions on the package. These sprays can be 
obtained through a dry cleaning supply store or stores that 
sell marine related products.
