Hand Carved Wood 
 
There are many accessories throughout a Leader’s Casual Furniture® showroom that are hand carved 
wood.  Artisans pick pieces of dried timber and hand craft designs one at a time.  Although items of the 
same SKU# may look similar, no two are alike.  Some of these carvings are left in their natural wood 
color and others are hand painted and hand embellished to bring uniqueness to your home. 
None of our wood accessories are machine carved.
