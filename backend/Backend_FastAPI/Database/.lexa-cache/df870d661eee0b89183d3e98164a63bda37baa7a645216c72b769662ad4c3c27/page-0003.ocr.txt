Company Overview:  From 1961 to present day Sunbrella fabrics continue to rise  
to the occasion, providing high quality performance fabrics for every corner of life. 
In 1961 Sunbrella debuted as an alternative to cotton, the most popular awning fabric at the time. Sunbrella, a 
fabric made of acrylic fibers with pigmentation added prior to extrusion, offered the rich look and feel of cotton, 
but did not fade or degrade. Even in the brightest sun, Sunbrella offered years of carefree service with a 
warranty that was unheard of in the marketplace. A product so drastically different from anything else available, 
Sunbrella grew to be trusted as the awning fabric that was guaranteed against the elements. 
Already a recognizable name in performance fabrics in the awning market, in the mid 1970s boaters soon 
discovered the good looks and durability of Sunbrella fabrics for boat tops, sail covers, and marine upholstery. 
With its durable and easy-cleaning properties, it was a natural fit to meet marine needs. Around the world 
today, Sunbrella is the No. 1 fabric choice for power boaters and sailors, enjoying universal name recognition 
synonymous with quality and durability. 
In the early 1980s the Sunbrella team was approached with the idea to make fabric furniture. The idea was 
simpleâ€”take the winning formula of high-performance awning fabric with the look and feel of cotton, to 
outdoor furniture. The Sunbrella team had a vision of durable umbrellas and furniture cushions made of 
Sunbrella. At the time, vinyl was the most popular material for outdoor furniture and a high-performance fabric 
that looked like an indoor fabric was almost too good to be true. But again, Sunbrella became a popular choice. 
Over the years, all of the nation's leading casual furniture manufacturers have adopted Sunbrella fabrics for 
their premium furniture lines. 
In 2002 Sunbrella began blending the line between indoor and outdoor.  Thanks to intricate jacquard weaving, 
innovative yarn constructions and advanced fabric finishes, the design and manufacturing teams at Glen Raven 
created Sunbrella fabrics that match the look and feel of fine interior fabrics. The same fabric that you trust for 
your outdoor upholstery is beautiful enough to transform the way you view the performance of indoor fabrics. 
Today you will find Sunbrella throughout the home: from decks, patios and poolside, to dining rooms, family 
rooms and even kitchen and bath. 
In 2011 Sunbrella celebrated 50 years! For a brand that started out as an industrial-grade awning fabric in only 
six colors, Sunbrella fabrics have come a long way. From awnings to marine to casual furniture, Sunbrella fabrics 
have led the industry with extensive styles and colors while providing unparalleled performance. Today, 
Sunbrella is used in a variety of innovative new products that offer creative solutions for consumers and the 
design community.
