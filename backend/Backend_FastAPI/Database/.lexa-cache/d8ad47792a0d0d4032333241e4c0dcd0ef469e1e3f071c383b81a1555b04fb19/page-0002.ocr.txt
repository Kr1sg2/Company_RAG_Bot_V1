number of a SKU that will be kept at a location. If you reserve the item off your floor 
and it has a minimum stock level a new item will automatically transfer to your store on 
the next transfer to refill the meet the minimum level.

NOTE:   Overstock items or items that have a quantity greater than the minimum stock level will not 
automatically transfer out. If your floor becomes crowded with canceled stock orders or 
random merchandise transferred in, it is the store team’s responsibility to work with their 
territory leader to get the surplus product transferred out.
