The Product Configurator 
The Product Configurator is a powerful tool and should be used to enter items you are ordering 
on a Sales Order.  It contains 95% of all items we can order.  The real magic happens because 
the configurator will only let you configure options on items that are available.  Throughout the 
configuration process, the configurator creates the correct SKU and correct pricing without the 
user having to look up or reference any pricelist.  Be patient while the Product Configurator 
sorts through ordering options.  The time savings and accuracy create synergies throughout 
Leaders and increases our customer experience

have load times of up to 10seconds between choices.  Be patient.  It is worth the wait to 
get complex orders right the first time.
