Card Not Present 
If the credit card is not present or the guest wishes to put a credit card on file with Leaders, then 
follow the steps below.  A card on file is “tokenized” so that the card information is encrypted 
and cannot be accessed by anyone.  Having a method of payment on file with Leaders follows all 
Red Flag and PCI compliance rules set forth by the United States Government.  Having a card on 
file with Leaders makes all future orders easier for the guest.
