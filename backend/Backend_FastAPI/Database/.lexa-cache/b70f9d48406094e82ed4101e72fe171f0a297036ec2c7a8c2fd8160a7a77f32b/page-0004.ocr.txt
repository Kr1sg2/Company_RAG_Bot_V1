7/4/2024 
2. Writing the Sale 
Writing a sale in NetSuite is easy.  There are three areas you need to be concerned with. 
1. Primary Information   
2. Items 
3. Signature/Billing/Delivery 
 
1. Primary Information 
✓ Location 
o Location will already be set as a default for your customer record.  If you are 
helping at another location, you will have to change this to the location you are 
helping at manually 
✓ Sales Rep 
o The Sales Rep name will default to the team member’s session that is open.  If 
you are writing a sale on another team member’s log-in, you will have to change 
this manually. 
2. Items 
✓ Use the 
 button to add new items to the sales order. 
o Be patient, the configurator is sorting through many options only to show you 
the options currently available.   
o Note that you can add items directly to the Sales Order by typing them in the 
line.  Typing directly on the line is not recommended other than special 
circumstances outlined in further training. 
✓ Estimated Ready Date 
o Once you have entered the product, complete this field.  The Estimated Ready 
Date field drives your customer follow-up reports and helps you manage open 
orders. 
3. Shipping/Billing/Signature 
✓ Ship To Select 
o The Ship To address is the address product will be delivered to or picked up 
from 
✓ Select the Payment Terms 
✓ Click the 
 button and follow the prompts
