Cleaning & Maintaining the Aluminum Frames 
 
Always wear eye protection to prevent foreign liquid or material from entering the eye. 
 
It is best to remove soiling and spills as they happen as they will be much easier to clean.  
This can be done by rinsing the product thoroughly with fresh water and brushing with a 
soft bristle brush if necessary. 
 
To remove stubborn dirt or stains from the frame or heavy soiling that has accumulated 
over time clean the frames with warm, soapy water and mild soap.  Brush with a soft bristle 
brush as necessary.  
 
To maintain the original luster on smooth finishes use a fine automotive wax and follow the 
directions as specified on the container.  Take care not to get excessive wax in the fabric as 
it will be hard to remove.  On textured finishes periodically apply mineral or baby oil. 
 
 
 
 
DO NOT USE A PRESSURE WASHER TO CLEAN YOUR FURNITURE.   
IT WILL VOID YOUR MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY. 
The force of the compressed water can damage or remove the finish and could harm the fabric.
