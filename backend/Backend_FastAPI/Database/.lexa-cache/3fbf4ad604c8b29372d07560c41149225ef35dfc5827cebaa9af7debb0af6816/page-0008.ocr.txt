FIRE MEDIA INSTALLATION 
 
Please follow the instructions below to add the finishing touch to your Fire Pit. Your Fire Pit needs a 
fire media in order to get the proper flame characteristics from the burner assembly.  The media 
can be lava rocks, decorative fire glass, fire logs, or other fire media specifically designed for 
outdoor fire pits and fireplaces.  
 
DANGER Do not block the pilot area or blowout box. Proper air flow is required in order to prevent 
suffocation and possible gas buildup. Incorrect media installation will cause the pilot flame to 
suffocate and turn off the fire pit or delay main burner ignition. If the main burner does ignite quickly, 
gas can build up in the burner tray and ignite violently. Ignition of gas which has built up can create 
an unsafe condition, and may cause injury or death, and may damage personal property. The 
deeper your lava rock or glass the more risk of reducing or smothering the flame from the burner.  
 
 
Lava Rock Only Application  
 
1) Install your Fire Pit per instructions.  
 
2) Apply lava rock ONLY deep enough to cover ring 
and pan- less than 2‚Äù above fire ring.  
 
       
 
 
3) Blow Out Box: Do not cover vents with lava rock- 
leave open. Do not allow any rock to block flame 
opening.  
 
                      
 
 
4) Blowout Box: Do not cover blowout box vents or 
opening with lava rock or glass. Incorrect media 
installation will cause the pilot flame to suffocate 
and turn off pit or delay main burner ignition.  
 
Decorative Glass Application  
 
1) Install your Fire Pit per instructions.  
 
2) Add base layer of lava rock as filler to hide pan 
and ring. Height should be only slightly above ring.  
 
       
 
 
3) Apply top coat of glass to lava rock just deep 
enough to hide lava rock. Make sure you do NOT 
cover the Blow Out Box. 
 
              
 
 
4) Blowout Box: Do not cover blowout box vents or 
opening with lava rock or glass. Incorrect media 
installation will cause the pilot flame to suffocate 
and turn off pit or delay main burner ignition.
