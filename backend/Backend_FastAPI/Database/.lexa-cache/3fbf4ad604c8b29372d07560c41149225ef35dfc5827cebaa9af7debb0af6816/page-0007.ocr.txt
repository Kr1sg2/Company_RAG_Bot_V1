Once the above connections are made, you can now connect your LP gas tank to the Fire Pit, using 
the standard propane gas hose with built in regulator (shown in blue) shown. Hand tighten the 
propane tank gas connector (shown in black), to the tank valve (shown in red). CAUTION: Do NOT 
use tools to tighten this connection Open the gas valve on the tank by turning the gas valve knob 
(shown in green) counter-clockwise (to the left) until fully open.  
 
To remove the gas tank, first turn off the gas valve by turning the knob fully clockwise (right), then 
unscrew the gas connector counter-clockwise (left) and move the gas hose to a secure location to 
prevent accidental damage. Then loosen the front tank retention bolt to remove from tank retention 
ring 
 
WARNING: Inspect the hose and tank connector before each use to insure there is no damage 
caused by rodents, weather or other conditions. NEVER use any Fire Pit which has any 
components, including the gas hose or gas tank connector damaged in any way. If you find any 
damage, turn off the valve on the gas tank and call a licensed repair technician to replace damaged 
components. Replace any damaged items with components that have the exact same ratings. 
 
WARNING: Before you turn on your Fire Pit for the first time, you must test your connections to 
insure there are no leaks. Gas from leaking joints can pose a serious threat to your personal 
property, yourself and others near this Fire Pit. NEVER use a lit match, lighter or other sources of 
fire to check joints for leaks. Use a gas leak detection kit available from your local home 
improvement store and follow all directions supplied by the manufacturer. 
 
WARNING: Inspect the burner assembly at least every six (6) months to insure there is no 
damage before use. Clean your burner, pilot and thermocouple at least every six months to insure 
proper operation.
