Choose a location with a minimum clearance of 48” from other structures. 
 
WARNING 
It is the responsibility of the person installing this unit to test and verify that there are 
no gas leaks after all connections are made. NEVER test for gas leaks with a flame. 
Use only a gas leak detector or gas reactant. 
 
WARNING 
Use only joint compound or tape that is approved for use with all types of gas. Apply 
to all male pipe fittings only. DO NOT use on FLARED fittings. Be sure all joints are 
tightened securely before lighting. 
 
WARNING 
Installation and repair should be done by a qualified service person. The appliance 
should be inspected before use and at least annually by a qualified service person. 
More frequent cleaning may be required as necessary. It is imperative that control 
compartment, burners, and circulating air passageways of the appliance be kept 
clean. 
 
DANGER 
When using glass media in a fire pit, use only approved fire glass and insure that 
there is only enough to hide burner. Applying over ½” of any media over the burner 
may create back pressure which can result in gas leakage from the air mixer. This 
may result in a dangerous situation which can result in personal injury, damage to 
property or death. 
 
DANGER 
Do not use this appliance if any part has been under water. Immediately call a 
qualified service technician to inspect the appliance and replace any part of the 
control system and any gas control which has been under water. 
 
 
 
Before you can enjoy your new Fire Pit, you must install the Table Top assembly on to the Fire Pit 
base and connect the Burner and Pilot Assembly to the gas valve and controls. These controls are 
mounted inside the Fire Pit, just to the right of the Gas Tank storage location. You must also 
connect a 20 gallon Liquid Petroleum (LP) gas tank (sold separately). 
 
Please read these instructions completely and make sure you understand them before proceeding. 
Incorrect installation can result in a dangerous situation which can lead to property damage, 
personal injury, or death. 
 
You need two people to properly and safely install the table top on the Fire Pit. Table tops are 
awkward to handle and can be heavy. Please exercise caution when installing the table top.
