One Sales Order – Delivery – Customer Pick-Up in Store - Manager Workaround 
 
If a customer takes delivery of items and wants to pick up the rest later in the store you can use this 
work around so you do not have to write the pick up items on a separate invoice.  You must have the 
support of a Store Manager to create the transfer. 
 
 
1. Write a Sales Order 
a. R:\3 About Customers and Orders\3.1 Writing a Sale 
2. Schedule items for delivery on a Leaders delivery truck 
3. When a remaining open item on the sales order comes into stock at the distribution center 
• 
Your Store Manager must transfer the items to your location 
• 
Change the “Reserve From” location on the line item to your store 
• 
This will show 0 (zero) in the Committed (Ready to Deliver In Fulfillment Location) column 
until the transfer updates 
 
 
4. When the transfer arrives and the DC updates the transfer,  your item will show Committed 
(Ready to Deliver In Fulfillment Location).  You do not need to change the Delivery Method on 
the sales order to “Customer Pick Up at Store”. 
5. Click Fulfill 
a. R:\6 About Delivery, Shipping and Transfers\2.1 Fulfill & Deliver Update 
 
You can repeat this as items arrive in stock in the DC until all lines of the sales order are fulfilled.
