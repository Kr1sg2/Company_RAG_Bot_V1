Push canopy support beam out to disengage tilt lever. 
 
Disassemble the main frame grip by loosening each of its 
four bolts, starting with the center bolt.  Remove the center 
bolt’s nut, but leave the bolt. 
Repeat the process on the two bolts on the main frame 
grip’s handle. 
Repeat again on the bolt at the front of the main frame 
grip. 
NOTE: When disassembling the main frame grip, it is important to remove only the nuts.   
Leave the bolts in the main frame grip.  This will prevent the pulleys inside from falling out. 
Before removing the handle side of the main frame grip, 
make certain all bolts are still in place. 
Carefully remove the handle side of the main frame grip, 
using one hand to steady the other half / hold the bolts in 
place. 
 
Remove the cord blocker.  Untie the knot in the cord and 
remove the cord from the cord blocker. 
Thread the new cord through the cord blocker and tie a 
small, firm knot at the end of the cord. 
Replace the cord blocker back into its appropriate slot. 
Carefully replace the main frame grip.  Use the nuts to affix both halves together.
