Preparation Checklist for Emergency Closing 
 
1. Umbrellas should be lowered and secured if any windy or gusty conditions are forecast.  Bring in 
umbrellas and other lightweight items.  If possible, bring them in while they are still dry so that 
mold and mildew donâ€™t form inside the folds of the fabric. 
 
2. If any severe weather is predicted to make landfall near your location, begin to prepare the store. 
Discuss a plan of action with your Sales Leadership team. 
 
3. Arrange to bring in all outdoor furniture displays or arrange with DC to have them stored 
elsewhere. 
 
4. Make sure no items that can become projectiles are left outdoors. 
 
5. Make sure storm drains gutters and downspouts are clear so that flooding is minimized. 
 
6. Post a printed document of contact numbers for your store team to reference in the event of a 
complete loss of digital access due to power loss. 
 
7. Stay abreast of local evacuation mandates.  Schedules must be developed and or approved by Sales 
Leadership. 
 
8. Empty and clean out the refrigerator and freezer. 
 
9. When leaving the store for last time before storm, please do a normal power down. 
 
10. Unplug computers and routers so that no power surges can cause damage. 
 
11. Stay in touch with staff during emergency event(s) as needed. 
 
12. When it is safe to return to the store, do so with caution and safely. 
 
13. Take photos of any damage. 
 
14. When safe, turn the power back on one breaker at a time, not all at once.
