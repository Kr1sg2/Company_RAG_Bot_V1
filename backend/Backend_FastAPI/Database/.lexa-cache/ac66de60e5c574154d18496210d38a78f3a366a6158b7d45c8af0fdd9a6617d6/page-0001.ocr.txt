Stores - Emergency Opening and Closing Procedure 
Tropical Weather 
 
Florida’s tropical weather may sometimes call for a store or stores to open late or close early. 
Should a named or numbered storm with expected winds sustained over 40mph (according to 
the National Weather Service) exist, Leader’s Casual Furniture® may determine that a store or 
stores may need to open late or close early. 
Should this determination be made, a member of the Sales Leadership Team will 
communicate with the applicable Showroom Manager(s). 
*Emergency Closings 
At times, emergencies such as severe weather can disrupt company operations. In extreme 
cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. In the event that such an 
emergency occurs during nonworking hours, team members will be notified of such a closing 
via telephone or email. 
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from 
scheduled work will be unpaid. However, with supervisory approval, team members may use 
available paid leave time, such as unused PTO benefits. 
In cases where an emergency does not require the office or store to be closed, team members 
who fail to report for work will not be paid for the time off. 
Team members in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are 
officially closed. In these circumstances, team members who work will receive regular pay.
