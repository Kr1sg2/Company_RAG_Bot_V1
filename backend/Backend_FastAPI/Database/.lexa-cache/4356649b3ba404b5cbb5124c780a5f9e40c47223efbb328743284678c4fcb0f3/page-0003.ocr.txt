UNPAID TIME OFF (UPTO) 
Employees must take all available PTO time before taking Unpaid Time Off (UPTO).  Scheduled UPTO is to be requested 
by using the UPTO template in the timekeeping system in the same manner that PTO is requested.  UPTO must be 
requested in advance and approved by your manager.  In the event you have PTO available, you must use all PTO prior 
to requesting UPTO. 
Holidays 
Leaders Holding Co™ recognizes two paid holidays during the year. All company locations will be closed on the following 
holidays and all eligible employees will be paid holiday pay: 
• 
Thanksgiving  
4th Thursday in November  
• 
Christmas 
 December 25th  
Full-time employees are eligible for paid holidays after completing 90-days of service. 
Non-exempt employees must work their scheduled workday before and after the holiday in order to be paid for the 
holiday, unless they are absent with prior permission from their supervisor. 
Paid Time Off (PTO) Redemption Policy 
Eligible team members include all full-time, hourly (non-exempt) team members working at the Distribution Center or at 
a Showroom.  This policy does not apply to any team members who work offsite or are salaried (exempt).   
A minimum of 40 hours (or 5 days) of PTO time used per year is required.  Any unused PTO time beyond the 40 hours (or 
5 days) can be redeemed as outlined below.   
50% of Wage 
Any amount of unredeemed PTO over 40 hours can be redeemed at 50% of the team member’s wage. To redeem your 
unused PTO you must submit a PTO Redemption form, signed by your supervisor, to Human Resources 30 days prior to 
your anniversary date. The redeemed PTO pay will be paid on the paycheck following the team member’s 
anniversary.  Team Members will not be paid for PTO time prior to their anniversary date.
