You must submit your form to redemption of unused PTO time at least (30) days prior to your anniversary date.  
2. 
If you do not show up for work or work your full day during one of your redemption days, this will not count as 
a redemption PTO at 50% wage.  Instead it will count as a regular PTO day and be paid according to the regular 
PTO policy. 
3. 
You must take a minimum of 40 hours (or 5 days) of PTO time per year before you can redeem PTO.  This is 
required by law.  Any unused PTO beyond the 40 hours (or 5 days) can be used for redemption at 50% wage.

Under no circumstance will paid time off redemption be pre-paid, it will be paid in the check(s) immediately 
following the scheduled time off
