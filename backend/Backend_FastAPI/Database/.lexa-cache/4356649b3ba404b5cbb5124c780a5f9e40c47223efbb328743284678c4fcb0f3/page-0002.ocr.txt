1.1 Paid Time Off 
8/15/2024 
Paid Time Off (PTO)  
Leaders Holding Co™ believes that employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away from work to help balance 
their lives. The benefits of PTO are that it promotes a flexible approach to time off. Employees are accountable and 
responsible for managing their own PTO hours to allow for adequate reserves if there is a need to cover vacation, illness 
or disability, appointments, emergencies, company closures due to natural disasters and other unexpected events, or 
any other situations that may require time off from work.  The company has established this paid time off (PTO) policy to 
meet those needs.  
Only full-time personnel are eligible for PTO and PTO redemption.  PTO is awarded on the employee’s anniversary date 
as follows:

PTO is to be arranged to be mutually convenient for the employee and the company.  PTO requests must be submitted 
through the timekeeping system at least one (1) week in advance of your first approved PTO day.  PTO requests will be 
reviewed, approved or denied based on several factors including staffing requirements and business needs. PTO periods 
are granted taking into account operating requirements of the company and previously acknowledged PTO requests.  PTO 
priority is determined on a first come first served basis not considering seniority. If you are a part time employee or do 
not have any available PTO, please request unpaid time off through the timekeeping system to document your approved 
time away from work. 
An employee may only take a PTO day for the day(s) they are not working their scheduled day(s).  Five (5) awarded PTO 
days are allowed to be used toward unscheduled PTO.  Unscheduled PTO is time off without prior approval from your 
supervisor or manager including sick and personal days.  Non-exempt employees having unscheduled absences beyond 
five (5) days are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.    
PTO and PTO redemption pay for salespeople will be paid according to the Procedure Manual, Policy 1.45 Guarantee and 
Payroll Guidelines.   
An employee may roll over a maximum of 40 hours of unused PTO from the previous anniversary year.  
Employees who resign will be eligible to receive a payout of their remaining PTO balance if they have given a two (2) 
week notice and a three (3) week notice for managers.  Resigning employees may not take any PTO during the notice 
period.  The employee must fulfill all duties of their position in a satisfactory manner for the entire notice period to be 
eligible for the PTO payout.  The payout will occur after the last day of work on the next scheduled paycheck.
