Cleaning and Care 
Preventative Maintenance 
Leader's Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to 
clean does not mean that it will not get dirty in an outdoor environment.  A little preventative 
maintenance goes a long way in keeping your new furnishings looking new, longer. 
Regular periodic care of your outdoor furniture & umbrella will help maintain its appearance and 
functionality better than occasional, heavy-duty maintenance.  Consider the specific conditions and 
usage to which your product is exposed so appropriate maintenance can be planned.  
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric.  Regular cleaning of outdoor 
furniture & umbrellas will help to prevent its forming.  Do not place flowerpots or any items on the 
furniture that will leave stains.  Do not place hot items directly onto resin furniture to avoid 
discoloration. 
Covers 
Covers can be purchased at a great price for any size furniture, umbrella or table including 
sectionals and fire pits.  Using a good quality, weatherproof, breathable cover for your purchase 
whether you are out of town, while the leaves are dropping, through pollen season, or through 
seasonal rains will not only reduce the amount of cleaning you have to do to keep your furniture 
looking new, it will also reduce the use and exposure to cleaning agents.  Please send us an e-
mail if we can help you with selecting and purchasing covers at 
solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com. 
 
CORROSION BLOCK® 
CORROSION BLOCK is a product that was developed specifically for the marine and 
aviation industry to protect aluminum.  When used as part of your regular 
furniture maintenance program it will ensure you get the maximum life out of 
your outdoor furniture.  Leader's Casual Furniture is an authorized CORROSION 
BLOCK dealer.  Please see your local store or our website to place an order. 
NOTE: CORROSION BLOCK also works beautifully on stainless appliances in your 
home or your outdoor kitchen. 
 
Application is Easy: 
Spray CORROSION BLOCK® onto a rag and wipe the painted metal surface.  Do not spray 
CORROSION BLOCK directly onto the surface from the can.  Over-application will make your 
furniture feel wet and slippery.
