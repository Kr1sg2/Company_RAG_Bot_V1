Safety 
Use of umbrellas in need of care and maintenance, use of umbrellas not secure in 
their base, or use of damaged umbrellas can result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if 
unaddressed, can become major repair and service issues that can create potential 
safety issues.   
Check to ensure your umbrella is secure in it's base before each use.  Never use an 
umbrella in windy conditions. 
✓ Close and store the umbrella in windy conditions or when a storm 
approaches.  Never allow the umbrella to flap in the wind; this could cause personal injury, 
damage to personal property, and damage to the umbrella.  
✓ Do not use tilting functions during breezy, gusty or windy conditions.  
✓ Keep the umbrella secured to the umbrella base at all times.  
✓ Do not leave an open umbrella unattended.   
✓ When adjusting the umbrella, ensure that no person(s), item(s), or personal 
property are close to the umbrella.  This is important to prevent injury or 
material damage.  
✓ Do not allow children to play on or with an umbrella or umbrella base.  
✓ When adjusting or assembling the umbrella or umbrella base, ensure fingers, 
toes or any other body parts are clear from moving parts.  Failing to do so many result in serious 
injury 
✓ Always lower and tie umbrellas shut when unattended.
