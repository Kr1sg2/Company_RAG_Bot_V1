What Is NOT Covered: 
Failure caused by unreasonable or abusive use, or failure caused by neglect of reasonable and necessary 
care, and any modification to product are not covered by this warranty.  We will only warranty products 
which are properly secured to an adequate base or mounting system and adhere to our required base 
weight minimums. 
Additionally, this warranty does not cover acts of nature (including but not limited to wind, hurricanes, 
tornadoes, and storms).  This warranty covers return freight of any warranted product only for the first 
year.   
This warranty does not cover Closeout and promotional items sold by the dealer as is. 
Wind Damage: 
Treasure Garden highly recommends that no umbrella, regardless of size or weight, ever be left 
unattended in the open position.  In windy conditions, it is further recommended that umbrellas be 
closed, removed from their base, and stored, or laid horizontally.  This will reduce the risk of damage to 
your umbrella, furniture, and other belongings or property.  To ensure stability of your umbrella, please 
observe proper placement, and use sufficient weight (base).  The Treasure Garden catalog contains 
minimum recommendations for necessary weight for each style.  Keep umbrella properly secured to 
umbrella base at all times.  Thoroughly read and follow all provided instruction manuals. 
WIND DAMAGE IS NOT COVERED UNDER OUR LIMITED WARRANTY. 
Irregularities in Production Process: 
The possibility of "Irregularities" in the product surface may occur during the production process.  
However, these irregularities do not reduce the quality of the product.  Treasure Garden monitors every 
stage of production to ensure a clean and consistent appearance on every part. 
Rust: 
Rust is a natural part of the aging process of all Steel or Iron based materials and is therefore NOT 
considered a defect.  Treasure Garden Cast Iron & Steel plate bases are designed to require minimum 
maintenance.  Bases should be kept clean. 
Do not let dirt build up on the bases.  Cleaning with mild soap and water, and seasonal touch-up of any 
scratches, chips or occasional rust seepage from crevices or hidden, un-finishable surfaces inherent in 
some designs is all that is required.  Touch Up paint in matching frame colors are available through your 
retail dealer. Never leave bases standing in water. To keep your bases looking their best, you may wish 
to store them when not in use for an extended period of time. 
Seaside and indoor pool usage: 
CAUTION: Seaside and indoor pool use, salt & chlorides can accumulate on the powder coat finish, 
leading to finish failure.  Failure or neglect to make needed cleanings may cause paint to blister, and 
such failure will void limited warranty. 
NO RETURNS ON CUSTOM, VALANCE OR DESIGNER COVER STYLE UMBRELLAS.
