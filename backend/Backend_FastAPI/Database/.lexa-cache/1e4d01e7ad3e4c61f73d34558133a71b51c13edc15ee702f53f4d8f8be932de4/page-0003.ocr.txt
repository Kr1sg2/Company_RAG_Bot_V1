Lift AKZ and carefully place it back onto the rotating hub. 
Reinsert and tighten the main frame bolts to affix the main frame stand to the rotating hub.   
NOTE: When disassembling the main frame grip, only remove the nuts.  Leave the bolts in the main frame grip.  This will 
prevent the pulleys inside from falling out. 
Disengage the tilt lever arm and turn 
to the side holding the bolts. 
Disassemble the main frame grip by 
loosening each of its six bolts, 
starting with the center bolt. 
Remove the nuts and half of the 
main frame grip. 
 
 
Thread the new cord through pulleys 
as shown above. 
 
Using the hex wrench, remove the 
bolt holding the loop lock stopper in 
place. 
 
Pull cord through the center of the 
loop lock stopper to create a small 
loop.  Then remove it from the 
frame. 
 
Subsequently remove the broken 
cord from the loop lock stopper. 
Thread the new cord through the 
loop lock stopper as shown above. 
 
 
Place the knot into the hole in the 
main frame stand and slide the loop 
lock stopper in. 
Reinsert and tighten the bolt.
