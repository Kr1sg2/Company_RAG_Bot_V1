Do you know   
 Toss Pillows?  
   
 
One of the quickest and most cost effective ways to enhance the décor of any room is by adding a variety of toss 
pillows.  Toss pillows are a great way to introduce texture, color, patterns and comfort to seating and dining 
collections while creating a compelling visual effect that reflects the ultimate decorative touch! 
 
Whether you want a seasonal shake-up or you are looking for a trendy, vibrant change, it is easy to do with the right toss 
pillows.  Combine wild patterns, bright colors or trendy styles to give your home an updated look and make a huge visual 
impact on your room – inside or out!  Because toss pillows don’t require a big commitment like furniture, you don’t have 
to be afraid to change them often and live a little on the dangerous side. 
 
 
Can different combinations of Toss Pillows create different styles? 
Contemporary - for a fresh, clean, modern flair here are a few tips: 
 
Choose an odd number, like 3 or 5, rather than traditional pairs 
 
A few larger pillows will look cleaner than lots of small ones 
 
Limit your color palette to only a few complimentary colors 
 
Traditional – time honored appeal that gives a room the classic warm lived-in feel 
 
Choose pairs of pillows and arrange on either side of a sofa or loveseat for symmetry 
 
Pair a large square pillow with a small odd shaped one for texture and visual appeal 
 
Layer a variety of colors, patterns and textures to keep your room looking lively 
 
It is best to choose one “busy” pattern and pair with a few simpler ones to get the 
best combination 
 
Eclectic – give your room a spontaneous anything goes attitude 
 
Choose an odd number of pillows on any item to convey the spirit of non-symmetry 
 
If you are really daring try a pair of pillows on one side and a third on the opposite end of a sofa 
 
Be sure that there is at least one color in common with all of the fabrics chosen in order to create unity
