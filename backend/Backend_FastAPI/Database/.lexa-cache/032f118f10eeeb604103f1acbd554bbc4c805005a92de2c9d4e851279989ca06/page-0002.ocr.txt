How do I pair colors and fabrics?  
If you get stuck choosing color and fabric combinations than grab inspiration from a 
favorite painting or piece of art.  Choose fabrics that combine small patterns with large 
ones as opposed to all small or all large patterns for the most visually appealing and 
interesting combinations. 
 
For a no fail way to add toss pillows without fear, simply add a patterned throw 
pillow onto a solid color chair or sofa to add contrast.   
 
Here are some tips to help when choosing three coordinating fabrics to 
compliment any room.  First, choose an anchor fabric â€“ a pattern that you love 
which all of the other fabrics will revolve around.  Your anchor fabric should have a minimum of three colors.  Next, choose 
two more fabrics, each having one or two of the anchor fabric colors in their patterns.   
 
The three fabrics should vary in contrast and pattern scale; one dark, one medium, one 
light and one large pattern, one medium pattern and one small pattern.  If you like all 
three of your fabrics to be patterns, than be sure that you choose one straight pattern, 
and two curvy or vice versa for the best look.
