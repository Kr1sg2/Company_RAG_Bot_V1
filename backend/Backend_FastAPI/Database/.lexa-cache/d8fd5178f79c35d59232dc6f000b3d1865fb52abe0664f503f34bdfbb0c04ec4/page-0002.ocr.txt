Care & Maintenance
King StarBoard is the first building material specifically developed to endure the constant 
punishment of the sun, water and weather in harsh marine environments. We like to say that it 
is the first “environmentally stabilized” marine polymer sheet. Unlike wood, wood laminates and 
ordinary plastic; it will not, warp, rot, discolor or delaminate. King StarBoard is made to maintain 
its shape, color and finish for the life of your boat.
The King StarBoard family of marine-grade polymers is also chemically resistant. Most chemicals, 
except the harshest solvents and acids, will have little effect on the material.
There is not much you have to do to keep it looking new. The following are a few tips on care and
maintenance to keep all King StarBoard parts looking new.
•	
Keep teak oil and other wood preservatives and stains away from King StarBoard components. 
They may permanently stain King StarBoard.
•	
Rust stains are very difficult to remove from King StarBoard, especially light colors. Keep 
uncoated metals away from your new King StarBoard.
•	
Soft deck shoes are recommended for walking surfaces made with King StarBoard marine 
polymers. Hard, black soles can leave scuff marks that are difficult to remove.
•	
Do not mark the material with pencils, pens or magic markers. If you are constructing or
attaching something to King StarBoard, use china markers or wax pencils.
•	
Clean up any gasoline spills immediately with a water and soap flush.
•	
King StarBoard will melt if exposed to extreme heat. Your boat builder has chosen King StarBoard 
for particular applications based on normal environmental conditions and considerable testing. Do 
not subject the material to a consistent operating temperature of over 150º Fahrenheit. Heat sourc­
es such as hot plates and lit cigarettes can mar the finish.
•	
You will not be able to paint King StarBoard. Even polyurethanes do not hold to the material for 
long.
