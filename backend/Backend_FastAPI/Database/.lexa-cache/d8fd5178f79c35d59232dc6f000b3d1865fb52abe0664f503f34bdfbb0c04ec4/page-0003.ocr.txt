Cleaning
Cleaning parts and accessories made with King StarBoard marine polymer is very simple:
•	
To clean everyday dirt and stains, use a cleaner such as Soft Scrub® and a nylon scrubby
or stiff nylon brush. Scrub lightly; excess force can mar the finish.
•	
Persistent stains will usually go away if you soak the area with bleach. Do not use 100%
chlorine used to treat swimming pools and do not use a pressure washer.
•	
To clean a petroleum stain such as grease or oil; use a citrus cleaner, alcohol or mineral spirits.
•	
For severe petroleum-based stains, spray with WD40®. Then use toluene or acetone and a 
white nylon scrub pad (colored pads release staining dyes when combined with acetone).
•	
Do not use MEK, turpentine or naphtha solvent.
Furniture polish or products such as Armor-All® can add an attractive luster to the finish of King 
StarBoard and hide small surface blemishes. To prevent slipping, do not use these products on 
walking surfaces.
If a mark or stain won’t come out, you may lightly sand the area. Be careful to only work on the 
stained area because sanding will remove the matte finish.
Any high-quality silicone marine caulk works well to replace old or worn caulking. Before 
caulking, the surface should be prepared by abrading it with medium-grit sandpaper; cleaning it 
with acetone, toluene or alcohol, and flame treating.
