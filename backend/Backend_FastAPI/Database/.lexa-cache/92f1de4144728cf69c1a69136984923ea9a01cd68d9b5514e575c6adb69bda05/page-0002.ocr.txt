1/23/2022 
Day of Visit 
1. The Inventory Team will complete the inventory count at a location in a single day.  They will show up before the 
Store Teams regular hours. 
2. Their first task will be to count the cash drawer first if it is available.  If the cash is hidden as mandated in the 
store procedure, then the inventory team will ask the first store team member in the store for the store cash for 
reconciliation. 
3. The inventory team uses a report with color pictures to cycle count each location. 
 
4. They will choose a clockwise or counterclockwise strategy based on the location. 
5. Please be available to the inventory team but not in their way.  The inventory team will ask for store team 
participation before they leave the location. 
6. The inventory manager will reconcile all of the items missed in the first count before the team leaves the 
location. 
7. The inventory team will make every effort not to disturb the showroom floor presentation.  Please partner with 
the team and help them recover an area after they cycle it.   
Post Visit
