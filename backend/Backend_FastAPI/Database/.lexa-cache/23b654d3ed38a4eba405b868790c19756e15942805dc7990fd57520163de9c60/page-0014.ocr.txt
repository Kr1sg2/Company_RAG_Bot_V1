Activities Tab  
The activities tab has many helpful tools for advanced users.   
✓ Calendar

✓ Event 
o Event records reserve time on your calendar for appointments and meetings. When you 
create an event, you are the owner. If you are invited to an event and accept, you are an 
attendee. You can click on an event displayed on your calendar to see more information 
about it, such as the location and a list of invited people. 
✓ Call 
o Schedule or plan a call to follow up with an opportunity, guest, vendor, or any other 
phone communication.  In a call record, you can take notes and track the date and time 
of the communication. 
✓ Task

tasks for individuals, companies, or contacts. 
Customers Tab
