Reminder 
What? 
Sales | Quote Activity Due 
If you properly set your “Next Activity” dates on your open 
quotes, this reminder will tell you which quotes must be 
followed up on and are past the “Next Activity” date. 
Sales | Sales Orders Pending 
Approval (Showroom) 
Sales Orders must have a deposit to be approved.  Sales 
Orders will not reserve merchandise if they are not approved.  
Work with your territory Leader to correct anything in the 
report.   
Sales | Special Orders on Hold 
A special order is placed on hold when the purchasing 
department does not have enough information to process it. 
The purchasing department will email you with questions. 
Please respond to the purchasing team immediately to 
prevent further delay.   
Sales | Commissions Approval 
Needed 
Sales Orders with pricing errors or repetitive mistakes made by 
the same sales associate that cause the company unnecessary 
expenses will show up in this search.  A sales order in this 
search will not pay a commission when fulfilled.  Resolve them 
with your territory Leader.

This report gives you sales orders that you can combine with 
existing fulfilments, reducing trips and increasing guest 
satisfaction.

Sales | Past ETA (My Showroom)
