6 Tiles 
 
The tiles are open transactions listed by type for you and your store.  They should be looked at every 
morning to give guests the fastest and best experience possible.   
 
The top row, “Mine,” will only show your transactions.  The bottom row, “Store,” will show the 
transaction for all of the team members assigned to the location.   
Please note that if you cover at a different location and write a sale at a different location, the sale will 
show in the “Mine” tiles and not in the “Store” tiles because the sale was written for a different location.
