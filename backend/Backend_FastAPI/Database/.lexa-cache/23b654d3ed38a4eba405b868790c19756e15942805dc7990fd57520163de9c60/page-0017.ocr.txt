Products Tab 
This tab helps you see our stock of fabric.  More advanced users like to keep track of our fabric stock to 
make sure there is enough fabric for their order.  This is not necessary; however, we have provided the 
data.  It is very rare that we are out of a fabric. 
 
Fabric Inventory 
✓ Shows the estimated yards we have on hand of each fabric 
Central | Open Orders By Yard 
✓ This is a report that can be searched by fabric name or number to see how many yards are 
needed to produce unmade orders.   
 
If the Central | Open Orders by Yard is greater than the Fabric Inventory Yards on Hand (Estimated) 
amount, we may run out of fabric for your order.  You can drill down further by looking up the incoming 
purchase order of the fabric you are researching.   
 
Type the fabric number you are looking for in the global search at the top of the window, followed by a 
“-“.  For example: o4099-

lines on the screen to see a summary of your location's open cases, the case status, the last time the 
case was looked at and who is assigned to the case.
