 
   
Greasing a post on a swivel chair  
Time:  
Under 15 minutes per base  
Tools needed:  
 
2 flat head screwdrivers 
 
A friend 
 
A blanket, towel, or mat that can get dirty 
 
White distilled vinegar 
 
Clean shop rag  
 
Corrosion block or white lithium grease 
 
Instructions:  
1.  Lay out a towel or mat on the floor to protect your chair’s finish and your flooring  
2.  Place the chair on the towel or mat with swivel base facing up. 
3. Inside the shaft you will see a metal post with a plastic sleeve around it. Using the screwdrivers gently 
pry back the plastic tabs. Wedge the screwdrivers in between the plastic and the metal post. DO NOT 
pry the tabs to far back or they will break!                     
 
4. With your friend standing one side of the chair and you on the other you both hold the screwdrivers in 
place while twisting and pulling on the base. For extra leverage you can put a foot on the arm of the 
chair. CAREFUL! The base may pop off. 
5. Now that you have the base off you will need to clean the post and sleeve with vinegar and a clean 
towel. This will remove any corrosion, dirt, or grime. Make sure to dry it off. 
6. Apply the grease to the post. Put on just enough to coat the post and around where the post meets the 
chair. There is no need to grease outside of the “ring” left by the base.
