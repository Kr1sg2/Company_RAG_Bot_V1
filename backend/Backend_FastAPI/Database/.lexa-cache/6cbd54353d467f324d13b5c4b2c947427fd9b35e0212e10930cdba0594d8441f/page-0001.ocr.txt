 
 
Community Give-A-Way 
Purpose:  
To drive traffic and make people talk about Leader’s Casual Furniture 
How it works: Each store team, led by the store manager, will select a community to perform a give a 
way contest.  The store team will get in touch with the home owners association and 
work through them to set up a tasteful display of a give-a-way set of the association’s 
choice.  The winner can choose any set on the signage for the contest.  They do not have 
to select the set the association chose to have on display.  The set must be in a public 
area off the community.  There will be a clear locked ballot box and fliers tastefully 
placed on the display as well as an easel showing all of the choices the winner has and 
the rules of the contest on the back. 
Rules:  
 
1. NO CASH SUBSTITUTE.  If the winner does not select a prize from the exact items offered they 
forfeit the contest and another winner will be randomly selected. 
2. Winner must show a drivers license or utility bill with an address in the community where the 
contest is taking place to claim their prize.  The winner is disqualified and a new winner will be 
selected if this is not done within 30 days of the first notification of winning. 
3. Must be at 18 or older to qualify 
4. Entry form must be completely filled out to be eligible to win 
5. Winner will be notified by E-mail and telephone 
6. Winner gets to choose from ****listed items only**** 
7. Winner will be selected by a blind drawing at the Leader’s Casual Furniture corporate office. 
8. Family and Friends of Leader’s Casual Furniture employees are not eligible to win. 
This contest will be released as soon as we receive acrylic ballot 
boxes for your team to place in the community, about 3 -4 
weeks.  Please think about the community you would like to 
have your contest in, establish communication with them and 
get permission.   
Give-a-Way sets are attached on the spreadsheet.
