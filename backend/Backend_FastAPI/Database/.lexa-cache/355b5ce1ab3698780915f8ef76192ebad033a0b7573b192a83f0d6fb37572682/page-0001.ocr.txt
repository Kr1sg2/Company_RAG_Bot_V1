 
2010 Warranty Procedures for Customer  
 
1) In order to properly process warranty claims made by your customers, we must ask that you 
obtain certain information, and follow certain procedures. Ours is a limited warranty and 
certain restrictions may apply if the part is not covered or has been subjected to misuse, 
neglect, or accident. Please review the Warranty provisions so you will know exactly what is 
covered.  
 
2) You first need to make sure that the customer mailed the green Warranty Registration 
Card, included with the handbook, to the Big Green Egg Warranty Center in Atlanta, 
Georgia, as required. 
 
3) You, as the Big Green Egg Dealer, should attempt to resolve any claim for repair or 
replacement under the terms of the warranty.  If it is a valid warranty claim fill out the 
Warranty Replacement Form. Return the form to Palm Coast Sales for processing. If for 
some reason you are unable to correct the problem or do not feel it is a valid claim, you may 
direct the customer to contact your respective distributor /Palm Coast Sales at 561-932-1800. 
 
4) Remind the customer that under the terms of our warranty, they are responsible for all cost of 
shipping and handling.   
 
 
5) If the claim is not covered due to accident, misuse, etc., they should purchase the 
replacement part from your retail department.
