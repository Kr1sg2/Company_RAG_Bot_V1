CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS  
GENERAL
Lightly brush off any excess debris. Prepare a cleaning solution of 1part soap to 10 parts water. Spray fabric 
with solution and use a sponge or soft bristle brush to clean, making sure that the fabric is completely soaked 
through. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow fabric to air dry.
TOUGH STAINS
Prepare a cleaning solution of 1part bleach to 4 parts water. 
Soak the entire trouble spot with the cleaning solution and scrub with a sponge or soft bristle brush until stain is 
removed. Apply more solution as necessary. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow fabric to air dry.
If the problem area is severe, the amount of bleach in the solution may be increased as needed.
