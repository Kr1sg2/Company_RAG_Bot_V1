Why merchandise to the plan?  Accessories & Add-On items complete our 
presentation to the customer, increase foot traffic in our stores, create repeat 
customers and & increase our average sale.  We are doing ourselves and our 
customers a disservice if we don’t present the product in the best way possible, 
merchandising like items and pairing styles together appropriately to maximize our 
selling opportunity and enhance the customer’s experience. 
 
 
 
What will I receive on my floor?   
• 
Each store will receive 4 rugs racks that hold 6 rugs each.   
• 
Each store will receive a total of 24 rugs in the bestselling size (approximately 8x10 foot rectangle) to 
merchandise in their Rug Racks. 
• 
Each store will receive additional natural color pallet rugs as back stock.  When a rug sells out of your 
Rug Rack, please replace it with a neutral back stock rug until the keep is refilled.  This will keep your 
racks looking full & merchandised, while reducing the quantity you need to keep on hand. 
• 
If you would like to show an additional rug on your floor, underneath a collection, please add an 
additional rug manually to your transfer waiting list so not to interfere with the rug rack display.  If you 
choose, we can update your keeps to correspond if you email us with your plan. 
 
 
How should I Show?  Following is the Merchandising Plan for each Rug Rack, along with suggestions on what 
collections to merchandise each rack with or near.  Please be sure that your Rug Racks match this plan, as 
inventory has been ordered & keeps have been entered to correspond.  Remove any exterior wrapping that 
blocks the view to the customer and if needed re-roll the rug with the top side facing out.  Customers should be 
able to see & feel the texture of the item.
