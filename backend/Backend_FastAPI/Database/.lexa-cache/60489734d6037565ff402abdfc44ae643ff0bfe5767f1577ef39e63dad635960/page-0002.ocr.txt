3/29/2024 
Emergency Closings 
At times, emergencies such as severe weather can disrupt company operations. In extreme 
cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility. If such an emergency 
occurs during nonworking hours, team members will be notified of such a closing via 
telephone or email. 
 
Contact the Sales Leadership team for final closing decisions.  If the Sales Leadership team cannot 
be contacted, base your decisions on official news sources and keeping your team safe.  Social 
media and some commercial news reports may tend to have inaccurate or unsubstantiated 
information.

Automated Emergency Update Line 
For the latest information regarding an emergency that impacts any part of the company, 
team members can call (727) 538-5577 ext. 5411 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  All messages 
left at the extension are forwarded to the Solutions Center. 
Emergency Closing and Paid Time Off 
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from 
scheduled work will be unpaid. However, with supervisory approval, team members may use 
available paid leave time, such as unused PTO benefits. 
In cases where an emergency does not require the office or store to be closed, team members 
who fail to report for work will not be paid for the time off. 
Team members in essential operations may be asked to work on a day when operations are 
officially closed. In these circumstances, team members who work will receive regular pay.
