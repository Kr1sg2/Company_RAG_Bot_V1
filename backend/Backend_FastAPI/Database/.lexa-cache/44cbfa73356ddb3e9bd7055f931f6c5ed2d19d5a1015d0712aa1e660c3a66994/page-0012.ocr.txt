Spills 
Even the hardest dried on spills are simple to resolve. Most can be taken care of with a wet dish rag.  
Occasionally a little more effort is required. For best results donâ€™t spot clean, clean the entire area. It 
is important to note that the table must be fully dry before making an evaluation on your efforts. 
Take the time to let the top completely dry before escalating your method. Follow the grid below:

I know you keep 
your table clean 
but dirt and dust 
accumulated, and 
the water ring 
draws in dirt to 
create this spot.  
Clean the entire 
table surface to 
remove all soiling. 
Spray Simple Green 
on the entire 
surface and let 
stand for at least 
one minute. Rinse 
surface with clean 
water, wipe dry.  
If ring persists 
repeat but this 
time scrub the 
area of the ring 
with a soft nylon 
brush. 
Use a clean wire brush.  In the 
direction of the grain, apply a 
heavy pressure and buff in a 
single direction. Repeat till the 
area of concern disappears.  
Clean surface with a damp towel.
Not going in the direction 
of the grain will cause the 
surface to appear different.
