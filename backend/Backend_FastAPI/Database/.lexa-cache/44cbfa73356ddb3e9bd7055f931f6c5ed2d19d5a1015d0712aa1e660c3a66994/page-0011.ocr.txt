Personal Protection 
When you perform maintenance and cleaning always keep safety 
in mind. Protect your eyes and skin from chemicals by using eye 
protection, protective clothing, and gloves.  When using any type 
of cleaner, especially bleach, do so in a well-ventilated area. 
 
 
 
 
 
Regular Maintenance  
Regular cleaning of PoliSoul Timber is easy. A wet dish towel to wipe the surface down 
after each use is sufficient. We recommend the application of Meguiar’s Extreme Vinyl 
Protectant to give your beautiful new furniture added protection.  By applying Meguiar’s 
Extreme Vinyl Protectant on your furniture, it will make it even easier to 
maintain.  Application is simple, spray and wipe.  Applying Meguiar’s 
Extreme Vinyl Protectant is very similar to using a granite top daily 
cleaner, and just as easy.
