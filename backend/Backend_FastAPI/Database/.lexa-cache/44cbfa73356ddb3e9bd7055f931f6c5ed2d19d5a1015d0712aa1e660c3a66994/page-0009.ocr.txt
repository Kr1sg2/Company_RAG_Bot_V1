Cleaning Cushions- What to Use 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the cushion on 
end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the 
frame and the cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy 
solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse thoroughly 
with fresh water.  Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE SEAMS OF 
THE CASE. 
If and only if your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as SunbrellaÂ®, you may 
use 1 part bleach mixed with 1 part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a small 
inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse the 
cushion thoroughly to remove all of the bleach solution.
