 Company Overview:  Tropitone's goal is to provide our customers what they want, when they 
want it – the first time, every time. We may never fully achieve that goal. But we will never stop 
trying. Back in the early 1950's, post-war families in the USA were establishing households and 
becoming mobile. Cities were once again vibrant and enjoyable. Suburban communities were 
being created with clusters of new homes and apartments that included lawns, gardens, patios 
and pools. Roads were built to connect the suburbs to the cities. Eventually, 46,000 miles of the 
US Interstate Highway System would connect an entire continent with convenient and 
economical travel by car and truck. The success of the post-war economy was creating the need 
for faster air travel. Vacation and leisure time were becoming an expected part of everyday life. 
Hotels, motels, clubs and vacation resorts were built to take advantage of the explosion in travel 
and leisure. All of these homes, apartments, hotels, motels, clubs and resorts needed outdoor 
furniture for the lawn, garden, patio and pool. The Tropitone Furniture Company and the 
Tropitone® brand were born in 1954 when Mr. Burt M. Baker bought the Sarasota Redwood 
Furniture Company and switched from redwood to aluminum for the frames of his outdoor patio 
furniture. The Tropitone Furniture Company was originally established to serve the commercial 
market for outdoor patio furniture that included hotels, motels, clubs and resorts. Tropitone® 
brand outdoor patio furniture could soon be found around the lawns, gardens, patios and pools of 
commercial properties around the country. Tropitone eventually decided to fill consumer demand 
by offering commercial-performance outdoor patio furniture at retail. The Tropitone® brand of 
outdoor patio furniture changed the performance standards of an entire industry by applying the 
rigorous product and service requirements of the highly - demanding commercial outdoor patio 
furniture market to the residential market.
