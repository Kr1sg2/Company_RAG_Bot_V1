4.1 
Carefully place the canopy structure 
upside down. 
This will allow access to the screws 
at the notch. 
The notch will be touching the 
ground with the screws facing up for 
easy access. 
 
 
4.2 
Unscrew all the screws from the 
notch. 
Once again, be careful not to bump 
or dislodge any of the ribs or rib pins. 
It is not necessary to remove the 
screws, just loosen them completely. 
 
4.3 
Carefully separate the top half of the 
notch from the bottom half. 
If necessary, use a flathead 
screwdriver to separate both halves. 
Be careful not to dislodge other ribs 
or rib pins. 
 
 
 
 
If the notch cannot be screwed back 
together, it is because some of the 
rib pins have been dislodged. 
Use the screwdriver to set them 
back in place in the notch.  It may be 
necessary to loosen the notch 
screws to do so. 
Once all the rib pins are set in place, 
screw the runner back together. 
Ensure that the ribs are firmly in 
place in the runner. 
Remove the broken rib from the 
notch. 
Discard the broken rib. 
Remove it carefully from the notch, 
so as not to disturb the other ribs. 
Insert the rib pin through the rib end 
of the new rib.  This should be done 
at the longer end of the rib. 
Now insert the rib end and rip pin 
through the gap in the notch.  Make 
certain the rib pin is in place inside 
the notch. 
Screw the notch back into place.
