Once the rib is removed, tighten one 
screw opposite the removed rib.   
This will help hold the other ribs in 
place. 
Now that the canopy structure is 
free, carefully stand it up as shown 
in fig. 3.1. 
Using the screwdriver, carefully 
unscrew all the screws from the 
runner. 
Be careful not to bump into the ribs 
or the runner, as this would dislodge 
the runner and cause the ribs to 
collapse and rib pins to scatter. 
It is not necessary to remove the 
screws, just loosen them completely.

NOTE: 
Carefully remove the broken rib and 
rib pin from the gap in the runner. 
Again, use caution so as not to 
dislodge other ribs from the runner. 
Insert the rib pin through rib end of 
the new rib.  This should be done at 
the strut (the shorter end of the rib.) 
Now insert the rib end and rip pin 
through the gap in the runner.  Make 
certain the rib pin is in place inside 
the runner. 
Screw the runner back into place. 
The new rib should now be hanging 
from the runner and the broken rib 
should be hanging from the notch. 
If the runner cannot be screwed 
back together, it is because some of 
the rib pins have been dislodged. 
Use the flathead screwdriver to set 
them back in place in the runner.  It 
may be necessary to loosen the 
runner screws to do so. 
Once all the rib pins are set in place, 
screw the runner back together. 
Ensure that the ribs are firmly in 
place in the runner.
