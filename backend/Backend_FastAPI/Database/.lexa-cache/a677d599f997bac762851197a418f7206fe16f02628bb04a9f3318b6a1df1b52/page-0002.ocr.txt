8/17/2021 
Cell Phone Etiquette 
Almost everyone has a cell phone.  You may even feel unprepared if you do not take it with you 
everywhere you go.  It is not acceptable to carry a personal cell phone on your person in a Leaders 
Furniture selling floor at any time.  You may bring it with you to work and you may leave it on.  However, 
the cell phone ringer and vibrator must be turned off. 
At no time is it acceptable to answer or talk on a cell phone in a Leaders’ showroom while a customer 
is present in the showroom regardless of whose “up” it is.  If you must have a cell phone conversation, 
you must not have a customer you are waiting on in the store and you must either excuse yourself out 
the back of the showroom or to the stockroom. At no time is it acceptable to talk on your cell phone on 
the selling floor or outside in front of the showroom. 
✓ You may bring your cell phone to work 
✓ Phone must be set to silent at all times in the showroom 
✓ No cell phone conversations at any time in a showroom when a customer is present 
regardless of who’s up it is 
✓ Cell phone use is restricted to the stockroom or the outside back of the showroom
