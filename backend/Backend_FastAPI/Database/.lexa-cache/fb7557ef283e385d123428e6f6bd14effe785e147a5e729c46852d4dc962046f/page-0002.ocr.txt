o Each Vendor has a multiplier based on the quantity purchased that you can find here: 
R:\Contract Design Rental Info\Contract Sales\Pricing\Contract Price List & Delivery Fee 
Schedule.pdf 
o The discount multiplier is to be applied to Leader’s Casual Furniture® Everyday Low 
Price – NOT GROUP PRICING or any other discounts! 
 When entering a contract sale, the Lead-Line “Lead-Contract” must be entered into FROG in 
order for the pricing to be approved 
 Warranty on commercial sales are different then the residential warranty. Please refer to each 
vendor’s specific commercial warranty when quoting it to the client. Warranties can be found 
here: R:\Contract Design Rental Info\Contract Sales\2015-16 Contract Warranties.pdf 
 Quantity Discount Carry-Over: 
o Whenever a client reaches a certain quantity discount, they are eligible for that same 
discount on future purchases. However, the quantity discount doesn’t keep adding up 
with additional purchase: 
 
Customer purchases 50+ pieces on their 1st order. They come in 8 months later 
and purchase an additional 8 items. Give them the 50+ quantity discount on the 
8 items. Please make an order memo on the account as to why they are getting 
the quantity discount on the new purchase to remove any uncertainty 
 
Customer purchase 35 pieces on their first order. The next purchase, they 
purchase 15 pieces. We would not give them the 50+ quantity discount because 
the two orders “add-up” to 50 pieces.  
 How is our delivery charge determined, and do we offer different types of deliveries? 
o We offer 3 different delivery options: 
 
Curb-Side –set-up, assembly, and garbage removal is not included. This is the 
lowest cost option available for the customer, but offers the least amount of 
service 
 
Please note in the top memo field if the customer is selecting this 
delivery option so the warehouse knows not to set-up and un-wrap 
the furniture. 
 
Delivery and Set-Up at One Location-this is the same   full delivery service that 
we offer to our residential customers to one location. All set-up, assembly and 
garbage removal is included for this option. 
 
Delivery and Set-Up to Multiple Locations-offers the same service as above, but 
this is when an account needs our delivery truck to deliver to more than 1 
location for the same account. An example of this would be if we are delivering 
to a resort, and they have more than 1 area within the resort that the truck has 
to drive to and set-up the furniture. 
o The Quote Contract Quote can be found here: R:\Contract Design Rental Info\Contract 
Sales\Contract Quote Form.pdf 
 Do we offer the customer the ability to pick-up their order instead of paying for delivery? 
o If the customer would like to pick up their order at the distribution center there is no 
charge for this. 
o If the customer would like to pick-up their order at a store, there is a minimum $40.00 
charge for this.
