Monthly Focus 
What: Contract Sales 
Why: 
Contract sales are a great way to increase business by giving 
qualified commercial accounts a quantity-based discount as an 
incentive to purchase all of their casual furniture needs from a 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® showroom. 
When:  Leader’s Casual Furniture® can offer this incentive to any 
qualified commercial account at anytime anywhere in the 
world. 
Who: All store team members are able to work with these types of 
accounts and are required to know all of the proper steps in 
order to execute these types of sales. In terms of qualifying the customer, it cannot be delivered 
to a private residence, and the proper documents are outlined below.
