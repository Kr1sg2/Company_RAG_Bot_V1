 What forms of payment do we accept on Contract sales? 
o Cash or Check is the preferred method of payment. 
o Credit Card payments will have an additional 3% charge added to the sub-total. 
 
There is a “Lead-Line” required when this occurs: ”LEAD-3%” 
o No financing on Contract Sales 
 What type of contract sales qualify to be tax exempt? 
o Religious Institutions 
o  Non-Profit Organizations 
o Educational Facilities 
o Hotels, Motels, and Bed and Breakfasts 
o Resorts and Amusement Parks 
o Restaurants 
 What documentation is required for the customer to be tax exempt? 
o Customer needs a Consumer’s Certificate of Exemption. An example of which is below. 
 
For clients other than religious or government organizations, their tax exempt 
form must state that it is for furniture purchases. For example, a hotel might 
have a tax exempt form for food; this would not be applicable for a furniture 
purchase. 
 
o Payment must come from the organization/business that the furniture is being 
delivered to. It cannot come from a private individual. Here are some examples of this: 
 
Not Exempt: a school purchases furniture, but a parent pays for it with their 
own credit card. 
 
Not Exempt: a church purchases furniture for their pastor, but it is going to a 
house owned by the pastor, not owned by the church. 
 
Not Exempt: a restaurant owner purchase furniture, but does not keep the 
furniture at the restaurant; they bring it to their house.
