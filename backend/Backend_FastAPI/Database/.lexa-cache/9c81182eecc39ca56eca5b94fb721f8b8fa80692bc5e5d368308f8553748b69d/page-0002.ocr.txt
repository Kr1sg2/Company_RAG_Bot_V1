Cushion Density:  
All of our foam is high quality, virgin polyurethane foam.  Density and thickness vary 
according to its seating application.  Sofas and loveseats are thicker and less dense while 
dining and thinner cushions are denser.  Our foam may be used indoor and outdoor.  
Outside use of foam requires some care: the cushioning should be removed in the rain and 
should be turned on their side to drain if they do get wet. 
Definition 
Foam density is not weight.  It is actually a measurement of mass per unit of volume.  
Density is a function of the chemistry used to produce the foam, of additives used to 
increase density, and of any additives used to improve the combustion resistance properties 
of the foam. Flexible polyurethane foam is available in a broad range of densities, ranging 
from as low as 0.8 pcf to as high as 6 pcf. Most foam applications utilize foam in the 0.9 to 
2.5 pcf density range.  Foam density is a function of the density of the virgin, or unfilled 
foam. This is also called polymer density. If the foam contains no additives or fillers, the 
polymer density is the same as the overall foam density. When additives or fillers are used 
in producing the foam, the foam density will be higher than the polymer density.  Generally 
speaking, the higher the polymer density of the foam, the greater the cost of the foam. 
However, this foam will generally also have better physical properties including support and 
durability. If there is a concern for foam performance, it is always important to determine 
whether the foam contains any type of additives so that the clearest understanding can be 
established as to whether the foam density and the polymer density are one and the same.   
Flexible polyurethane foam density is measured in pounds per cubic foot 
(pcf)
