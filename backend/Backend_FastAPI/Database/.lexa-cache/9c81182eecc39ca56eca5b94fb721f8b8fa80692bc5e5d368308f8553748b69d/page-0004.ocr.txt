Railroaded vs Up The Roll Fabrics 
Railroaded fabric is best described by how the design is oriented on the roll.  The design will be created 
from selvage to selvage, or the width of the fabric. Say your fabric is 54 inches wide.  The design is 
oriented perpendicular to the 54 inch wide roll.  This is due to the fact when you're weaving, you want 
your filing yarns, or the weft latitudinal yarns, to create the designs.  You can have more color variation 
this way. If the design is created up the bolt or roll, the colors in the design are limited to the colors of 
the warp yarns or the longitudinal yarns. 
A common term used in home textiles is the term “railroaded” when referring to the orientation of a 
fabric.  When fabric is railroaded, it means the design is created from selvage to selvage.  The selvage is 
the edge of the fabric, usually referred to as the width.  So, if you have striped upholstery fabric, the 
stripes would run from selvage to selvage and not all the way up the roll.  
 
Fabrics are usually made in 54″ width.  This means the fabric is woven in a piece 54″ wide, and in nearly 
unlimited lengths.  After it is woven, the fabric is rolled onto a bolt for shipping and storage so there are 
no creases in the fabric.  Weaving fabric “railroaded” allows you to cover the entire sofa width in one 
horizontal piece of fabric without seams.  Some plain or solid color fabrics can be turned in any 
direction, so the importance of railroading a fabric is not as significant when dealing with these plains; 
however, when considering a Jacquard woven fabric with a specific design or texture, whether a pattern 
is railroaded or not can make a big difference in how it is applied to the cushion. 
There are times when the common 54" width of fabric is not enough to run the span of a piece of 
furniture.  For instance, if you have a very long cushion that exceeds the width of the fabric, The cushion 
would have to have a seam.  If the fabric is railroaded then the seam is not needed.   
In the illustration, consider the edges of the fabric (selvages), the iron rails the train rolls on, and the 
stripes or patterns are the cross ties.  If the intended top and bottom of the design motif is pointing 
toward the two iron “tracks,” the fabric can be woven at any length to span the length of the sofa back 
and beyond. If the intended top and bottom of the design motif is pointing right and left along with the 
“cross ties” of the railroad tracks, the pattern could look odd when applied to the sofa back.
