Dacron Wrap:   
Itâ€™s untrue that Dacron wrapping somehow makes your cushioning less susceptible to water.  
Dacron wrapping cushions have two purposes and they are: 
1. To fill out the casing the foam is in 
2. To create smooth and soft edges in the finished product.  
 You will see some seating cushions that appear to be all Dacron.  This is not Dacron.  It is 
what is called densified polyester batting.  This type of cushion, though comfortable, at the 
point of sale will break down and flatten out quickly.  There is no substitute for high quality 
polyurethane foam. 
    
 
Bagged Backs:   
Almost all of our cushion backs are blown fiber.  This blown fiber looks like Dacron but it is 
not.  Blown fiber is picked and lofted by a large baling machine and blown into bags to be 
used for back cushions and pillows.  This type of cushioning requires care.  Because it is a 
blown, lofted product it must be fluffed from time to time just like your bed pillow.  If you 
do not take care of this product it will start to sag. 
Buttons:   
Most buttons use steel cores.  All of our buttons have aluminum cores with nylon backs.  
This makes our buttons weather resistant.  Our buttons are covered with matching fabric 
and are pressed together.  Our buttons require very little care.  However, if you were to 
push hard directly on the button this could result in the nylon back becoming unseated and 
the fabric will peel off the button.  Our service department is trained and equipped to 
handle button services.  We have complimentary button replacement tools to assist 
customers with their replacement.
