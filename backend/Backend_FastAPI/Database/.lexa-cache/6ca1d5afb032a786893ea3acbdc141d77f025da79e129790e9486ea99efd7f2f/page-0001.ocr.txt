this fundamental knowledge, every team member will be able to best help the customer process 
a return/exchange to ensure customer satisfaction. 
FAQ: 
 How do I identify if an invoice is a Sale or a Credit Memo? 
o A Credit Memo invoice will begin with the letter “C” 
o Example: 1951649 is a Sale, C1951707 is a Credit Memo 
 When should a credit memo be put into the system? 
o Only after the Original sale ticket is Deliver Updated (Sale Type 9). 
 What happens when I create a Credit Memo? 
o The credit memo allows for the product to come back into inventory, refunding 
the customer or exchanging for a different item.  
 When does the product on the Credit Memo officially show as returned back into the F.R.O.G. 
system? 
o When the Credit Memo is Credit Memo Delivery Updated (Sale Type 9). 
 If I am processing an exchange, when does the rewrite/new ticket get put into F.R.O.G.? 
o The new order is put into the system before entering the Credit Memo.  This 
way, if you are utilizing funds from the Credit Memo to pay for the new order, 
the new order will already be in the system.  By doing it this way, it makes an 
easy accounting step for transferring money from sales invoice to another. 
 If I am processing an exchange, what do I enter when F.R.O.G prompts “Enter Refund Amount?”
