Showroom Manager Quarterly Incentive Program 
Program Overview 
The Showroom Manager Quarterly Incentive Plan is designed to financially reward individuals that make 
a positive impact on business by achieving, or overachieving, their stated goals on the KPI Scorecard.  
The program is based on targeted showroom monthly goals created each fiscal year by Sales Leadership 
and evaluated at the end of each fiscal quarter.  
Managers must be employed as the Manager in the same showroom for an entire fiscal quarter to be 
eligible for the incentive program.  In the event a Manager voluntarily resigns they must provide a Full 
Term of Notice (3 weeks) and be employed through the end of the fiscal quarter to be eligible for the 
incentive payout.  Management reserves the right to modify, suspend or cancel this program at their 
discretion.  
Program Details 
✓ KPI Scorecard – The incentive program is solely based on achieving goals established on each 
showroom’s individual KPI Scorecard.   
✓ Incentive Eligibility – A Showroom Manager becomes incentive payout eligible when they 
achieve 90% of their KPI Scorecard Quarterly Goal.  No incentive payouts will be granted to any 
Showroom Manager that does not achieve the baseline eligibility requirement of achieving 90% 
of their KPI Scorecard Quarterly Goal. 
✓ Incentive Payout – The incentive payout target is $1500 quarterly which totals to $6000 per 
fiscal year.  The KPI Scorecard and the Manager Quarterly Incentive Program are designed to 
provide the opportunity to exponentially reward individuals that overachieve their KPI Scorecard 
Quarterly Goal.  Each Showroom Manager has the opportunity to receive a payout greater than 
the quarterly target of $1500 when they exceed 100% of their KPI Scorecard Quarterly Goal.  
The maximum payout is 2 times the quarterly incentive payout target of $1500 or $3000 per 
fiscal quarter or $12,000 per fiscal year.
