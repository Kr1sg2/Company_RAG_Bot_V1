How does Palm Springs Conserve Fuel? 
All Palm Springs Rattan® product is delivered on our own fleet; using computer aided routing to help the drivers reach all of the 
customers in the most efficient manner possible.  All of our longer range deliveries that ride on our semis are guided by live GPS to 
help the drivers efficiently navigate around traffic and other obstructions ensuring the most direct route to the consumer using the 
least amount of fossil fuel. 
 
By first quarter of 2010 we will have Alternative Power Units (APUs) installed on our over the road semis to drastically reduce the 
carbon output and fossil fuel used while our trucks are at idle.  The unit will allow the drivers to maintain a comfortable environment 
with a/c, heat, and accessories while at a delivery stop or on overnight time off without excessive idling of the 500+ Horse Power diesel 
engines.  This will also prolong the life of the lubricating oil in the engines reducing the frequency of their change. 
 
Why is our product “Green”? 
Our rattan, a product found naturally in the forests of the tropical Pacific, comes from replanted government controlled sources in 
Indonesia and the Philippines.  The rattan is harvested from national forests or off of plantations that grow agricultural crops such as 
coco.  As the rattan is harvested from these sources it is replanted at a faster rate than it is harvested ensuring quality sustainable 
material for generations.
