Do you know how we are Green?   
 
How do we Conserve Electricity with lighting? 
Palm Springs Rattan® has been using daylight harvesting since 1995.  We currently utilize daylight harvesting 
throughout our 150,000 sq ft campus to cut back on electricity used for lighting, reducing our dependence on 
fossil fuels.  Utilizing massive skylights in the 57 foot high ceiling, the multi-level “runway” lights are 
automatically turned off every day by 8:30 AM when the Sun’s rays become bright enough to more than 
adequately light the heavy traffic work area.   
 
On the shipping docks where brighter color corrected bulbs are required Palm Springs Rattan® uses high output low energy 
consumption T8 fixtures with electronic ballasts.  These give more than adequate color accurate light to ensure the highest quality 
inspection to review our product with a fraction of the cost of traditional fluorescent fixtures.  Furthermore the lighting system over 
the shipping docks is divided into zones.  If a zone is not being worked, the lights are switched off to save even more electricity. 
 
 
How do we beat the Florida Heat? 
It gets over 90 degrees in the summer time!   Instead of running expensive A/C systems to help our warehouse 
team members stay cool in the hot Florida summer we utilize evaporative cooling systems.  With very minimal 
water consumption these highly efficient fans can reduce the air exiting up to 14 degrees by taking advantage 
of the properties of water as it evaporates.  This air cooling is done with almost no energy consumption 
compared to an air conditioning compressor unit. 
 
 
What does Palm Springs Recycle?  
All of the cardboard and paper packaging materials received 
in our distribution center is sorted, compacted, and then 
picked up and recycled several times a week.  Any boxes that 
can be reused are utilized to ship product out to our 
customers.  This reduces our dependence on paper products manufactured from natural resources.  In 
addition, when a delivery is sent on one of our fleet trucks, it is not boxed and wrapped with paper products.  We use reusable linen 
packing blankets to cut back on the waste we produce that would go to landfills.
