Cleaning Prolene with a Tacky Surface 
 
Occasionally Prolene product will go through a short period of time where the surface will feel tacky.  
This only happens once in the products life and can be remedied easily during the normal recommended 
cleaning. 
 
What you will need: 
1. Bucket or spray bottle 
2. Soft bristle brush 
3. Mild soap (laundry detergent or dish soap) 
4. Purple Power or Gunk Purple Degreaser  
5. Eye protection 
6. Cleaning gloves 
 
Cleaning the Product 
1. Move the product to an area where you can liberally spray a hose. 
2. Remove your cushions so you are cleaing the frame only.  If you need to clean you cushions you can 
do so with the warm soapy water or see Cleaning Outdoor Cushions on leadersfurniture.com for ore 
information. 
3. Put on your eye and hand protection to protect from accidental contact and irritation from the soap 
and degreaser. 
4. Mix warm water and mile detergent in the bucket or spray bottle 
5. Thoroughly wet the furniture with the hose 
6. Apply the warm soapy water by spraying or with your soft bristle brush and prepared bucket 
7. Thoroughly spray the degreaser on all tacky areas of the furniture 
8. Lightly but thoroughly brush the entire furniture frame 
9. Liberally rinse the entire frame to remove all of the soapy water and degreaser 
10. Allow the product to air dry.  You can use clean towels to speed the process 
 
It may be necessary to use the degreaser for more than one cleaning but the sticky will go away and not 
return.  The tacky surface is a temporary condition that occasionally happens.
