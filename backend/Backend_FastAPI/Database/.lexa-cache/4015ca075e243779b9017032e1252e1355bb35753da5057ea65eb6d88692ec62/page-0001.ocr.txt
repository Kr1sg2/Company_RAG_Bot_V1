Always where eye protection to prevent foreign liquid or material from entering the eye. 
 
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the 
cushion on end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew 
growth between the frame and the cushion. 
 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm 
soapy solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and 
rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD 
DAMAGE THE SEAMS OF THE CASE. 
 
 
If an only if your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as SunbrellaÂ®, you 
may use 1 part bleach mixed with 1 part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  
Check a small inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be 
sure to rinse the cushion thoroughly to remove all of the bleach solution.
