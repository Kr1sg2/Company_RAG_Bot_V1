3.11 Contract Sales

Contract Guidelines 
1. Do not shortchange the delivery charge.  Our margins are very low on contract sales.  
We need to get full contract delivery charge on every contract sale to keep the sale 
profitable and healthy for our company.  Why shortchange yourself?  Commission is 
reduced on the sale of merchandise because the margins are low.  You still make full 
commission on the delivery charge!   
You risk making no commission on the entire sale if the contract delivery rate scale 
is not followed. 
2. Try hard to not wipe out stock. On large orders of in stock merchandise try and give lead 
times so you will not affect retail rate of sale.  Sales Leadership & Purchasing can help 
you with this. 
3. Must charge 3% convenience fee if payment is by Credit Card. 
4. No order will be placed into production without half down. 
5. Do Not over Promise; if we panic, we can fail.  Give Leader's Casual Furniture® an 
opportunity to properly service your customer.  Do not promise unrealistic timelines.  
Remember, we deliver 2000 pieces a day in addition to your contract sale. 
6. If the salesperson transfers to another Leader's Casual Furniture® retail store the 
contract account sales volume stays at the original store location and the salesperson 
receives their commissions at their new store. 
7. How to determine 12+, 20+, 50+ pricing - Items that cannot be used without the other 
are considered 1 complete piece: 
a. Umbrella + base = 1 piece 
b. Dining chair + cushion = 1 piece 
c. Table base + top = 1 piece
