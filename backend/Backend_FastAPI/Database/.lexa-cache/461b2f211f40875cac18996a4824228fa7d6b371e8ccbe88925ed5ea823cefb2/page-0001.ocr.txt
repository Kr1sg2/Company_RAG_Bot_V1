Why merchandise to the plan?  Our goal is to maximize the your square footage 
but merchandising & putting together plans for your location that best represent a 
collection, show variety, accommodate your store size & most importantly reflect 
the customer’s needs specific to your location.  These decisions are made based on 
past sales statistics, demographic research, industry insight, special order capability 
and over all store presentation.  The objective:  a complete presentation to our 
customers, increased foot traffic, repeat customers & increased average sale. 
 What did we buy?  Decorative Fire Media sold in 10lb jars in a variety of colors, shapes & sizes. 
Why did we buy?  To provide our customers with more options to personalize their fire pits at a better value 
than our current fire pit manufactures provide.
