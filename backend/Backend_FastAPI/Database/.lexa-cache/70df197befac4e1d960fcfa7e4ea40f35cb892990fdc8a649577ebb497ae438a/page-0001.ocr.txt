 
Installing a replacement sleeve on a swivel chair 
Time: 
Under 5 minutes per base 
Tools needed: 
A towel or mat 
A friend 
A rubber mallet 
A wide flat head screw driver 
White lithium grease 
Disposable latex or vinyl gloves 
Instructions: 
1. Lay out a towel or mat on the floor to protect your chairâ€™s finish and your flooring 
2. Place the chair on the towel or mat with swivel base flat on the floor. 
3. Have your friend stand on one side of the chair and you on the other with your feet weighted firmly 
on the base and hold the arm of the chair. 
4. While grasping the arms of the chair pull up in sync while keeping your feet firmly planted on the base 
of the chair. 
5. The base will work its way off the chair. Be careful not to bonk each other when the base comes out. 
6. You should be left with a clean post on the chair bottom. 
7. Look into the base, if the old sleeve did not come out when the post did turn the base upside down 
and use a wide flat head screw driver and a rubber mallet to tap the old sleeve until it comes out of the 
base. Flip the base back over when done. 
8. After removing the old sleeve line the new sleeve over the opening and push in as far as you can with 
your hands. WATCH YOUR FINGERS! Then tap it in the rest of the way with rubber mallet until it is flush 
with the top of the base.
