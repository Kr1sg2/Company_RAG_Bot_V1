How do you clean King StarBoard® polymer products? 
Cleaning components, parts and accessories made with King StarBoard® outdoor polymers is 
very simple: 
 
To clean everyday dirt and stains, use a cleaner such as Soft Scrub® and a nylon scrubby 
or stiff nylon brush. Scrub lightly; excess force can mar the finish. 
 
Persistent stains will usually go away if you soak the area with bleach (do not use 100% 
chlorine as used to treat swimming pools)  
 
Also, stains and marks have been successfully removed with the following branded 
products: Goof Off®, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser®, GOJO Orange Pumice Hand Cleaner and 
Simple Green. 
 
To clean a petroleum stain such as grease or oil, use a citrus cleaner, alcohol or mineral 
spirits. 
 
In severe cases, spray petroleum-based stains with WD40®. Then use toluene or acetone 
and a white nylon scrub pad (colored pads release staining dyes when combined with 
acetone). 
 
Do not use MEK, turpentine or naphtha solvent. 
 
If a mark or stain won’t come out, you may lightly sand the area. Be careful and only 
work on the stained area because sanding will remove the matte finish. 
 
Any high-quality silicone marine caulk works well to replace old or worn caulking. 
Before caulking, the surface should be prepared by abrading it with a medium-grit 
sandpaper, then cleaning it with acetone, toluene or alcohol.
