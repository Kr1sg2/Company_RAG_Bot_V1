Search the page  
Searching a page is far more efficient then reading all the words.  To open a 
search box to search a page for a key word or number: 
1.  Press and hold <CTRL> and at the same time press <F>. 
2. Type the word you are searching for and press <ENTER>.   
3. It will take you to the first instance of the word if there are any on the 
page.   
4. Press <ENTER> again to go to the next instance if there is any.
