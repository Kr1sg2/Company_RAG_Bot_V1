Sticky 
“Sticky” is a term used in NetSuite to describe areas that when you make a choice, they “stick” 
the next time you are in a screen.  For instance, you can simply press 
 or if you click 
 it will stay the next time you have the option.  It will stick from the last choice.  The 
goal of Sticky is to make you experience more efficient.
