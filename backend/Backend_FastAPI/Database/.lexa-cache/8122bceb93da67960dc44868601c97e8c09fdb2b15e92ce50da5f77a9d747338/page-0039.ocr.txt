WARRANTY EXCLUSIONS: Limited Warranty does not include: product failure resulting from 
improper care or unreasonable use, careless unwrapping of furniture, neglect or abuse, acts of 
nature, rust seepage or bleeding, rust and/or oxidation of frame resulting in exposed metals that

invoice must be submitted with all Warranty claims; pictures may be required. Replacements will be 
charged at Customer's price level and credited only when damaged items have been received and 
inspected by Ebel, Inc. Damaged cushions and umbrellas will be picked up, where upon claim

right to refuse any Warranty Claims. No Return Merchandise will be accepted without a RAN. 
INTERNET POLICY: Internet policy, including MAP policy, is available. If you do not have a 
copy, please request one from your sales representative or Ebel, Inc. 
  
TRANSSHIPPING RESTRICTIONS: Ebel, Inc. sells only to authorized Dealers who sell to the 
ultimate consumer.  Ebel, Inc. reserves the right to select its Dealers.  No Ebel, Inc. Dealer 
shall sell or ship Ebel, Inc. products to a Dealer who is not authorized to sell Ebel, Inc. 
products.  
WEATHER WICKER & ALUMINUM: Use caution when opening boxes and removing bubble 
wrap. (Note: This type of damage is not covered by Limited Warranty.) Regular washing with non-
abrasive, mild soap & water will remove dirt, body oils, chemicals and other substances. Rinse 
thoroughly; do not pressure wash, and allow to air dry. 
CUSHIONS: Use caution when opening boxes and removing wrapping. (Note: This type of 
damage is not covered by Limited Warranty.) While resistant to fading and moisture damage, for best 
results, keep cushions away from extended exposure to moisture and direct sunlight. Should they 
get wet, always allow cushions to air-dry thoroughly before storage. Light stains/spots can be treated 
with mild, non-abrasive household cleaner. Consult a professional for heavy soiling. Mold and mildew 
will grow on dirt and spills. Spot cleaning as needed and regular maintenance will help prevent this 
from occurring. 
STAINLESS STEEL: Use caution when opening boxes and removing wrapping. (Note: This 
type of damage is not covered by Limited Warranty.) Stainless steel furniture requires regular 
maintenance to preserve its finish. Although it is generally resistant to corrosion, the surface is 
susceptible to cosmetic deterioration caused by the effects of salt water, salt air, chlorine, air-borne 
chemicals, etc. These cosmetic deteriorations, including rusting, are not covered under warranty. If 
you live in an environment susceptible to these conditions, powder-coated aluminum bases are 
available upon request, and are recommended. We recommend that you use Ebel, Inc.’s Stainless 
Steel Cleaner and Polish, as well as steel wool, to maintain the finish of your stainless steel. 
FIRE PITS: Use caution when opening boxes and removing wrapping. (Note: This type of 
damage is not covered by Limited Warranty.) Read the Fire Pit User Manual thoroughly before 
installation and use.  
CHAISE LOUNGE BACKRESTS: Chaise lounge backrests must NEVER be adjusted while seated in 
the chaise. Safely readjust the backrest while standing beside the chaise. Serious bodily injury may 
result from adjusting the backrest while seated. Wicker/frame damage resulting from adjusting the 
backrest while seated is not covered by Limited Warranty. 
LEVELING: Many Ebel, Inc. products have adjustable glides that can be used to level items. If a chair 
or table sits unevenly on the floor, first determine if the floor is flat. This can be done by switching it with 
another piece in a different area. If the wobble moves with the piece, inspect the furniture for a “longer” 
leg. Next, place a small block of wood on the floor under the “longer” leg. Lift the chair and firmly bring it 
down so that the “long” leg makes contact with the wood. This should adjust the “longer” leg. If there is 
a serious unevenness that cannot be corrected, please contact your local dealer.   
STACKING: Never move or store furniture that is stacked higher that the recommended stack heights. 
Failure to abide by the stack limits may result in scratching, rubbing, wearing, and/or breakage of the 
frame and/or wicker. (Note: This type of damage is not covered by Limited Warranty.)  
Ebel, Inc. reserves the right to make 
changes to furniture designs, 
specifications, and prices without prior 
notice. 
All previously published TERMS & 
CONDITIONS are invalid.
