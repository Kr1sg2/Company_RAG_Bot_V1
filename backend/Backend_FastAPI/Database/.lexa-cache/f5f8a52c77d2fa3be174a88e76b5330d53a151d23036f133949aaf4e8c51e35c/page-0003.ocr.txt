6/14/2022 
What Does The Inside Of A Propane Tank Look Like? 
 
 
 
Part 
What? 
OPD Valve 
Overfilling Prevention Device Valve consists of a pressure relief valve 
and quick closing coupling to improve the safety when using a propane 
tank. 
Low BTU Regulator 
Reduces the pressure from the tank to a usable level for the grill or 
firepit. 
Cylinder Collar 
Protect the OPD from accidental damage 
Regulator Tank Connection 
Threaded attachment point for gas appliances 
Tank Cylinder Shell 
Steel shell designed to hold liquid propane under pressure 
Overfill protection float 
This is a float swich that closes off the filling tube when the tank is 80% 
full.  It works just like the float in a toilet cistern.  By only allowing the 
tank to be 80% full, there is adequate room left in the tank, called 
headspace. 
Gas Hose 
Supplies the reduced pressure propane to the appliance 
Cylinder Foot Ring 
Protects the bottom of the tank and makes the tank stable in the 
orientation it should be used.  Please note that a horizontal tank has 
the foot ring for filling only.  A horizontal tank should be used on its side 
on the two additional welded on feet.
