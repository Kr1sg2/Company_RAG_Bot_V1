Frequently Asked Question 
1. The fill stations says I cannot get a full fill on my horizontal propance tank. 
a. Please read the sticker on the tank and follow the instruction for a full fill.   
 
2. How can I make sure my horizontal propane tank is not overfilled? 
a. Read the filling instruction on the label on the tank.  Watch the technician filling your 
tank and ensure they follow the specific instruction for your tank. 
b. All tanks should be filled by weight, not by pressure.  Make sure the technician filling 
your tank measures your filled cylinder's weight and it is in alignment with what is 
stamped on your cylinder collar.  Overfilled cylinders are not safe. 
3. Why won't my horizontal propane tank work if I overfill it? 
a. An overfilled tank is unsafe.  The safety devices in the Overfilling Prevention Device 
Valve outlined earlier in this document are trying to prevent an unsafe condition and 
may prevent your device from working properly. 
4. How do I know if my horizontal propane tank is overfilled? 
a. The easiest way to make sure your tank is not overfilled is to check the weight.  The 
cylinder collar will outline the manufacturer's recommended full weight.  Anything over 
this weight indicates overfilled.   
b. A trained filling technician can also check for an overfill situation by placing the tank in 
its correct operating orientation in a safe environment, while wearing the correct safety 
gear and opening the bleed screw on the tank's valve.  If liquid comes out and not gas, 
the tank is overfilled.
