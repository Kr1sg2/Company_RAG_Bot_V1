Propane Tank Instructions and Safety 
6/14/2022 
Making Sure Your Tank Is Not Overfilled 
An overfilled propane tank is not safe.  It can cause a propane appliance to burn too hot, ice up and stop 
working, or not work at all. 
A propane tank should not weigh more than the Tear Weight (TW) stamped on the tank + pounds of 
propane it is designed to hold. 
Example: 
A tank with a Tear Weight of 20.2 lbs filled full with 20 lbs of propane in it should not weigh more than  
40.2 lbs.  To be safe, you can subtract 1lbs and ask for a maximum weight of 39.2 lbs. 
How do I check the weight of my tank at home? 
You can check the weight of your tank by weighing yourself on a house hold scale, then weigh yourself 
again while holding the propane tank.
