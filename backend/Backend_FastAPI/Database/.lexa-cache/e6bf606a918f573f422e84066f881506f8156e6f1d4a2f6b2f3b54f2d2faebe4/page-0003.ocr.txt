0.01 Finding Information and Searching the R Drive 
8/17/2021 
Quick Search & Control <F> 
Windows now has a built in search box in File Explorer in the top right of the screen. 
Most other programs like WORD, EXCEL and Acrobat require you to open the search window. 
1. On computer keyboard click <ctrl> and <f>.  The <f> key in this case means “find.”  A small 
window will open somewhere on the top of the screen.  If a search window already exists, the 
cursor will begin flashing in that window. 
 
2. In Windows the search box is on top of the screen usually on the right side. 
3. Type the word or phrase desired in the window then click <enter>.  
a. The more specific the search term the more limited the results will be.  If you are too 
specific you may not find what you are looking for. 
i. For example:  If we want to know all about rattan, then type in ‘rattan’ in search 
window.  Many options using the word rattan will be shown.  If we want to know 
about taking care of rattan, then type in “rattan care” and we will see fewer 
options.
