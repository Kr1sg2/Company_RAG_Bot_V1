0.01 Finding Information and Searching the R Drive 
8/17/2021 
Searching the R: Drive | A Network Drive 
At Leader’s Furniture a primary value has always been to keep information accessible to all who need it.  
The R drive on the computer system is an encyclopedia of knowledge about our products and processes.  
This R (meaning Retail) is available to all team members at any time for research and for learning.  
The R drive is organized by category.  Think of the R drive as a digital file cabinet.  Within the drive are 
categories which could be thought of as drawers of files.  Within the files are documents.  When 
searching the R drive it is possible to look in the entire file cabinet, in all categories and in all documents, 
at once.  Such a search might yield many results depending on how much information exists about a 
searched item. 
 It is also possible to sort through the names of the drawers and files to limit how much data the search 
function has to do and results may be faster this way.  With a very little time it is easy to learn the best 
way to search the huge data field in R for what is needed.  
A great way to start the learning is to scroll through the file names in the R and open a few to see how it 
works.  The categories will be labeled “About Leader’s” or “About Products” or “About Training” for a 
few examples.  In these category files are documents related to those subjects.  But remember, it is 
possible to search the entire R drive at once but that will take longer than searching a category file. 
Below are the very simple steps for learning to research in R and its files. 
Here are the steps with visual illustration. 
1. Find the file icon on computer screen. It is generally across the lower tol bar. Some stores have 
an R shortcut installed on desktops. See image below. Look for the file folder with red arrow. 
2. Click on the file folder icon. Look for the drive named Stores R.
