Empire Collection Care and Maintenance 
The Empire Collection is a beautiful handcrafted blend of materials:  aluminum, fiberglass, resin, FRC (Fiberglass 
Reinforced Concrete, hand applied faux finishing, and cushions hand made in the United States.  Trying to pick a product 
to keep all of the materials looking great can be confusing.  Leader’s Casual Furniture® recommends a single product for 
all but the cushions, Turtle Wax Ice Spray Wax.  This great product can be sprayed on all surfaces and easily wiped with a 
dry clean cloth to protect your investment.  Turtle Wax Ice Spray Wax can be found at any automotive store and most 
Walmart and Target locations.
