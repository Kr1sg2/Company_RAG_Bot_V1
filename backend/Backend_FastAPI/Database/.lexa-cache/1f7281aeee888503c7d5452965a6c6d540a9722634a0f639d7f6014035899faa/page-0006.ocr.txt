against the record you are viewing.

 Print 
What 
The print function in NetSuite is a modern print process.  After hitting the button is starts with a print preview to 
make sure you are about to print what you want.  The preview window is similar to what you see in any good 
printing experience. 
Where 
The print button will not show up in Edit mode.  It will only show up in View mode.  When in View mode the print 
button will show up to the right of the menu buttons at the top or bottom of the screen.
