What? 
Required 
Why? 
Guest A guest is someone who has visited your showroom.  
They are not ready to buy but you started to build a 
relationship with them.  You know their name and 
their general interests.  You may use the $100 give a 
way to earn more specifics to add to their record.

Name 
Communication Preference 
Basic record that requires minimal 
information that you can follow up 
on at a later date. 
Opportunity  An opportunity is a guest who is getting serious 
about buying.  You have worked with them on 
products, have an idea of the size of the space 
available to furnish, you have an idea of what the 
project will cost, you know when the customer 
would like it by, and why they didn’t buy today.   You 
may not know all the products they want so you did 
not put it into a quote.  You can enter products on 
an opportunity. 
Guest or Customer Record  
One step above a Guest record.  
Require minimal information but 
you can add more specifics to the 
record. 
 
An opportunity can be converted 
to a sales order. 
Quote A quote is just like a sales order where you put 
specific items on a sales order but a quote does not 
reserve the items or bill the customer.  When a 
quote is emailed or printed it will not have brand or 
product specific information on it but it will have the 
items, a brief description and the costs associated 
with them.  Quotes do not reserve merchandise 
Guest or Customer Record 
Specific products a guest or 
customer would like to order that 
can be easily converted into a 
sales order. 
Sales Order / 
Customer 
Sales Orders turn opportunities and quotes from 
conversations to hard sales that reserve 
merchandise and create action.   Sales Orders can be 
edited.  A customer is just that, a person that has a 
full customer record in the system and has bought 
from us in the past.  To save a customer record the 
required fields must be complete.

Invoice An Invoice is a record that solidifies what part of a 
Sales Order has been fulfilled.  It defines the value of 
products delivered and the payments put toward 
those products.  If a sales order is paid in full before 
it is fulfilled the amount owed should be zero.   
 
 
Invoicing must happen to take 
deposits associated with an order 
and apply them to it.  Invoicing is 
the record that tracks the value of 
payments vs the value of product 
fulfilled in a transaction.
