Guest 
A Guest is a precursor to a Customer record.  A Guest is a person who has visited your showroom and expressed some interest but has not 
bought yet.    They are not ready to share a great deal of information with you.  They may have filled out a $100 give-a-way.  This allows you to 
populate the potential for follow up with limited required information.  Although there are a lot of useful fields only the fields listed in red are 
required to begin documenting your relationship with the Guest.  A Guest record will turn into a Customer record once a Guest has placed an 
order.
