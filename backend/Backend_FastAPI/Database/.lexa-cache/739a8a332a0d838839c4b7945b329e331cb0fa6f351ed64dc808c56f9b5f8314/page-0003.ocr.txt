Opportunity An Opportunity is a more detailed record of a Guest.  It starts to outline the Guest’s specific interests.  Opportunities in NetSuite will replace 
your paper follow up log.  The more accurately you use Opportunities the better you will be able to follow up with Guests and the more your 
sales will be protected.  Procedure 2.300 Whose Sale Is It is based on accurately logging your Opportunities.  You cannot have an Opportunity 
without creating a Guest record or linking them to an existing customer.   A Guest or customer can have multiple Opportunities.  When Guest’s 
specific interests are logged accurately it will give you the ability to use powerful tools in NetSuite to follow up in the most effective way, 
creating more sales, creating more income for you.  Although there are a lot of useful fields only the fields listed in red are required to begin 
documenting your relationship with the guest.
