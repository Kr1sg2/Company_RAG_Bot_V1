Quote 
A customer that is at Quote stage is very close to buying.  Quotes can be made for 
Guests or for existing customer records.  A Quote is a detailed outline of a potential 
transaction.  The only thing left would be final confirmation from the customer and a 
deposit.  Quotes will not need to be re-entered in the system and can be easily turned 
into a sales order.  Quotes do not reserve inventory.
