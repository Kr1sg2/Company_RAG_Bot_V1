LOVE YOUR PATIO MAILERS
to be used with construction permit list for local cities
Lists are available for construction permits pulled within 
the Leaders’ market area (Florida). These permits are pulled 
for pool, lanai/patio, screen enclosures, landscape or pool 
pavers and other situations requiring construction permits. 
Depending on your location, county or city regulations vary on 
what permits are available. You’ll address the envelope, use 
your address stamp, insert the mailer, seal and send to the 
Distribution Center for postage and mailing.
Contact advertising@leadersfurniture.com 
for printed mailers and permit lists.
DON’T FORGET:
If you know the address of a Commercial Property, you’ll address a 
blank #10 envelope, use your address stamp, insert the rack card with 
your business card, seal and send to the Distribution Center for postage 
and mailing. For more rack cards or blank envelopes, use your supply 
request.
