Cushion Cleaning Instructions: 
 
 
Supplies needed: 
 Cleaning solvent                                                  
 White paper towels or clean white rag 
 Hairdryer (optional but suggested) 
 
 
 
For spot cleaning, use a mild pure solvent (such as Carbona or Simple 
Green) and work in a well-ventilated room. Avoid any product containing 
carbon tetrachloride, as it is highly toxic. 
 
 Always pre-test cleaning agents on a hidden area. Wait until the fabric 
dries to confirm that fabric is colorfast prior proceeding.  Solvents must be 
properly used or there may be a "clean spot" or a noticeable ring left on the 
fabric.  
 
Before beginning, assemble required supplies (listed above). Place cotton 
cloth/paper towels beneath the stain (if possible). Apply cleaning solvent to 
another towel or rag (do not apply solvent directly to cushion). Promptly daub 
onto the stain, do not rub as this may cause the fabric to show wear more quickly. 
Dry immediately with the hairdryer to reduce the chance of the dyes running or 
leaving a “clean spot” (suggested). 
 
This process may need to be repeated in order to remove stain completely.
