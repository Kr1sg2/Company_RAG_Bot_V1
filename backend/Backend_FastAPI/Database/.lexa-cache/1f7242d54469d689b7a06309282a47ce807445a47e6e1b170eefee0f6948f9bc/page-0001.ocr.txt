Tax Exempt Customers 
Resale Tax Exemption Certificates expire on December 31st of every year unless they are for a non-profit 
or government agency.  Every year, your tax-exempt clients will have to update their certificates with 
you.  This is the law, and to be tax-exempt, there are no exceptions.   
Writing a Tax Exempt Order 
1. Obtain a clear copy of the customerâ€™s tax-exempt certificate and email it to Accounts Receivable 
(ar@leadersfurniture.com)  
2. A tax-exempt sale must be written to the company that provided the tax-exempt certificate.  We 
can deliver to a different address. 
3. Tax will be removed from the account once the tax-exempt certificate is received by Accounts 
Receivable.

Any sale leaving the United States is tax-exempt.  The tax will be charged at the time of the sale by law 
and will be refunded to the guest after they present the Bill of Lading or export documents from the 
shipper proving the product left the United States.   
Florida law provides criminal and civil penalties for the fraudulent use of 
Consumer and Resale certificates, up to and including a 200% penalty of 
the tax and prosecution as a third-degree felony.
