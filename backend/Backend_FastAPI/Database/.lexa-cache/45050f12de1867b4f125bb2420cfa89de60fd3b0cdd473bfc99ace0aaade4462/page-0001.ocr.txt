2010 Warranty Guidelines 
 
Building strong customer relationships at the retail level is an important part of your dealerâ€™s 
commitment; handling warranty issues is the responsibility of the dealer. Please encourage your 
dealers to handle warranty issues in store; this will generate good will and repeat sales from 
customers. Dealers in your territory should contact you if they have warranty questions or parts 
requests. If you are unsure of the answer to a warranty question you may contact Lisa Dunnam, 
Office Manager @ 561-932-1800.  
 
We will send parts as needed to replace the items requested on your warranty forms; warranty 
parts replacement will no longer be reimbursed by credit memo. The customer is responsible 
for any shipping costs if these items are sent to you separately. All parts requests must come 
within the calendar year that they were warranted. 
 
The ceramic components of the Big Green Egg carry a lifetime warranty to the original 
purchaser whose name appears on the purchase invoice, and who has registered their 
warranty with the offices of Big Green Egg. The warranty does not apply to damage caused 
by improper assembly, misuse, accidents, commercial use, mechanical alterations, negligence, 
improper care, natural or accidental disasters, nor to the gasket or a Big Green Egg temperature 
gauge. The Big Green Egg does not extend its warranty to chips or cracks of the exterior glaze, 
which may have occurred after the Egg was delivered to the dealer or distributor. 
 
All other products are covered for one year under normal use.  
 
Warranty Parts Guidelines 
 
All original ceramic parts for egg, including cast iron fire grates, are lifetime warranty. 
The warranty on the metal band and draft door is limited to five years, and does not cover rust 
or oxidation unless there is a loss of structural integrity.  Bands and nests are 5 years warranty. 
 
Pictures are required for all domes and bases (no exceptions) to be considered for warranty by 
Big Green Egg.  Pictures may be requested for other claims as well.
