 
Slings generally take 4-6 weeks to come in. Once they arrive , notify the customer  
 
If the customer is dropping off the item/s to be re-slung at the store ask them to bring 
the furniture in as close as possible to the day before the shuttle. Create CUSM invoice 
at this point if it has not already been done. 
 
If the customer is having Leaders pick-up the furniture, create 
invoice in FROG using LEAD-PICKUP. The charge for this is $99.00. 
This includes having the furniture being picked up as well as having 
it re-delivered once completed. This needs to be on a separate 
invoice. 
 
 You will have the items needed to be picked up on a separate 
invoice (CUSM) and you will link the 2 invoices together using the 
deliver with feature in FROG 
 
Whether the furniture is being dropped off at the store, or it is being 
picked up by Leaders, there is one final important step to be done: 
 
E-mail the warehouse group to have the furniture re-slung. If you 
fail to do this, the slings WILL NOT be put on the furniture. 
 
You will find this under the e-mail template titled “Resling 
Request” 
 
Fill out the information accordingly. 
 
If it is being picked back up at the store send the e-mail the day of the shuttle. 
 
The furniture will return on the following weeks shuttle  
 
If you have scheduled a LEAD-PICKUP, send the e-mail the day you schedule it. 
 
As a general rule of thumb, allow 1 week for the furniture to be re-delivered. If 
there is a need to have it done quicker, please contact the Warehouse Group 
and notify them and make sure that it can be done. 
 
Enter in the re-delivery date requested on the e-mail template’s subject 
heading.
