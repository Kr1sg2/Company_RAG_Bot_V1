If the customer is bringing in their furniture to go back on the shuttle, each piece of furniture 
needs to have a copy of the CUSM invoice attached to it. 
 
For example, if a customer is having 4 chairs and 2 chaises being sent back to the DC to 
be re-slung, you will need to print out 8 copies of the invoice.  
 
4 for each chair 
 
2 for each chaise 
 
1 for the customer to acknowledge that we are taking possession of their 
furniture

Transferring CUSM back to the DC 
 
Since this is created at the store, the items are not serialized in the system. In order to 
transfer the items back, the CUSM invoice number has to be hand-written on the 
transfer paperwork that is going from the store to the DC on shuttle day. 
 
The driver needs to sign off on this as well, acknowledging the item/s that are 
going back on the shuttle truck.
