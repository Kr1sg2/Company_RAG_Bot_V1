Monthly Focus 
What: CUSMs (Customer Owned Merchandise) and Re-Slings 
Why: 
At Leaders we take pride in the fact that we are able to service the products that 
we sell. Re-slinging furniture for our customers is an important and large part of 
doing exactly that.  
When: When a customer has a piece of furniture that needs to be re-slung, whether or 
not they purchased it from Leaders or not, if it is made by a vendor that we 
currently or at one time were a distributor of, we will do our best to re-sling 
their furniture. 
Who: All sales team members need to know the proper procedure in order to execute 
re-slinging furniture in order to provide our customers with the great service that they expect and deserve from 
Leaders.
