 
Business to Business Referral Program 
Goal: 
To create synergy and word of mouth from other companies.  The program will be structured 
with a reward system to promote the recommendation of Leader’s Casual Furniture’s Name.  
When someone asks where to purchase wicker, rattan, or patio furniture the goal is for Leader’s 
to be top of mind. 
Communicate it to the Community  
Fliers will be printed for the store personnel to hand out or mail to prospective companies (i.e.  Full line 
furniture stores, pool builders, accessory shops, home builders, remodelers, decorative paver 
companies, landscapers…)

How it Works 
Every time a referred customer makes a purchase $500 or more the referring person is eligible for a $10 
gas card.  The business card of the person who referred the customer must be submitted with the 
invoice.  The sales associate will attach the business card to the top of the manual invoice to send back 
to the Leader’s Casual Furniture corporate office with a signed thank you to the person that referred the 
customer.  The returned manual invoices with the business card attached will be copied; an addressed 
envelope will be made for each person that referred the customer and put in a folder and given to Tim 
Newton at the end of each month.  Tim will log each business that referred a customer to Leader’s by 
store location where the purchase was made.  This will allow us to see which Leader’s stores it is 
working for best, the type of business that synergizes with Leader’s best, and to spot any abuse in the 
system so that it can be looked into. 
The gas card will only be mailed to the business address on the submitted business card.
