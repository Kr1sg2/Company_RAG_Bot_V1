LUXURIOUS TEXTILES DESIGNED TO 
PROTECT WHAT MATTERS MOST.
Now more than ever, most of us are spending more time 
at home and are aware of the importance of disinfecting 
our surfaces. Have peace of mind in your space with 
Bella-Dura HOME.
Suitable for indoors or out – protect yourself, your loved ones, 
and your environment with a textile that is bleach cleanable.
Bella-Dura HOME fabrics are very easy to clean. Under normal 
circumstances a mild soap solution will generally do the trick, but 
bleach can be used for a more thorough disinfecting.
