Air Conditioning Trouble Shooting 
Delta T 
Checking to see if an AC unit is working properly is very easy with a temperature scan gun.  All territory 
leads and maintenance team members have a temperature scan gun.  All air conditioning technicians 
have a temperature scan gun.  If you would like your own, you can find them at home improvement and 
hardware stores. 
No air conditioning work should be considered completed if the Delta T is less than 16 Degrees.

How To Measure the Effectiveness of an AC Unit 
1. Using the temperature scan gun, measure the temperature of the air going into the AC unit.  This 
is called the return.  Sometimes the return has an air filter. 
2. Measure the temperature coming out of the AC at the first duct after the air handler.   
3. Calculate the difference in these two temperatures.  This is called the Delta T. 
(Temperature Going In) – (Temperature Coming Out) = Delta T 
Delta T

Before Calling for Service 
✓ Check the batteries in your thermostat 
✓ Check the setting of the thermostat to make sure the AC is on 
✓ Check to make sure the breakers are on for the AC system at the breaker panel.  Sometimes an 
AC unit is powered off at the breaker panel in error from the closing the night before.   
✓ Know the Delta T of each system in your location so that the service tech can be directed to work 
on the correct units.
