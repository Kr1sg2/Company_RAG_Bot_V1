Sandbox Training Environment 
 
Each log-in into NetSuite logs into the active Production system by default.  The production environment is where active 
live business happens.  This is where the company operates.  You can change to the Sandbox at any time to practice and 
train.  Sandbox is a training and test environment.  Any work done in the Sandbox will not affect actual company records 
and is only for testing, practice, and training. 
 
Why doesn’t everything work the same in the sandbox as it does in production? 
• 
Check Availability:  The sandbox is a snapshot and does not show current inventory levels. 
• 
Automated Exchange Process:  The custom programming to automate the exchange process references forms 
in the live system.  The process errors out in the Sandbox because the system cannot reach these forms that are 
hardcoded. 
• 
Pop-Ups:  Some pop ups will not work because they are flagged by programing that references the live system.   
To access the Sandbox: 
1. Log Into NetSuite 
2. From the home screen hover over the user name and session in the top right.  A drop-down menu will appear. 
 
3. A drop down will appear.  Select “:Leaders Holding Company” under “Switch To Another Account” 
 
It is clear you are in the Sandbox roll because of the word Sandbox on the header. 
 
Note:  The work you do in the Sandbox will not be in the live system.  If you mistakenly write a sale, schedule a delivery, 
or any other task for a guest in Sandbox it will not happen.
