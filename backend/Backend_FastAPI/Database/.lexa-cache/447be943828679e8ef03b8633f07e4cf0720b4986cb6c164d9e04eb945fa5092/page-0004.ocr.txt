Unfold new replacement canopy. Gather bottom of canopy (larger opening) to the top of
canopy (smaller opening). 
For octagon canopies, slide top opening of canopy over all 8 ribs (Fig. 8). For square and
rectangle canopies, start by sliding top opening of canopy over the 4 longest ribs (Fig. 9).
When the 4 longest ribs are inside canopy, pull the canopy up slightly and pull canopy over
the 4 shortest ribs. 
Once all 8 ribs are inside canopy, begin to slide canopy up while second person holds
canopy to prevent canopy from dragging on floor and getting dirty (Fig. 10). Continue to slide
canopy up ribs while safely climbing up ladder and second person moving over to ladder for
extra support (Fig. 11).
