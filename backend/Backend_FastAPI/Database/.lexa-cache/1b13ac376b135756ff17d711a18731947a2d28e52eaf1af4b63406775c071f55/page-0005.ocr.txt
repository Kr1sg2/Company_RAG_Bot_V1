furniture can result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if unaddressed, can become major repair 
and service issues that can create potential safety issues.  Contact the Leaders Furniture® Solutions

Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  
Inspections must include, but not be limited to, joint tightness, spring assemblies and the weld 
areas of the product’s, arms and legs.  If joints are loose or any cracks should appear on the 
product or at welds, the item must immediately be removed from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing 
hardware be detected, the item must be removed from service immediately 
until the hardware can be properly tightened and/or replaced.

Product failure caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and 
maintenance is not covered by the product warranty. 
Notice for Contract Installations:  Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage 
and/or indications of wear.  Such inspections must include all products of a like kind and model,
