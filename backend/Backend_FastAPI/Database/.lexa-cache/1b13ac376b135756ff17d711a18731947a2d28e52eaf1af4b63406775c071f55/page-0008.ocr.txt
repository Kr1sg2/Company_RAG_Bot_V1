*From date of delivery is defined as the delivery when the product was first delivered to the purchaser.  It does not include any subsequent 
delivery for any additional item(s) or item(s) replaced under warranty.  Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for five years.  If your cushions are 
made by fabric from one of these mills and the mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make you new covers for 
your cushions.  If you would like complete new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade.
