EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND POLICIES 
Employment Categories 
It is the intent of Leaders Holding Co™ to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so 
that Team Members understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. These 
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. Accordingly, the 
right to terminate the employment relationship at will at any time is retained by both the Team 
Member and the Company. 
 
Each Team Member is designated as either Nonexempt or Exempt from federal and state wage 
and hour laws. Nonexempt Team Members are entitled to overtime pay under the specific 
provisions of federal and state laws. Exempt Team Members are excluded from specific provisions 
of federal and state wage and hour laws. An Team Member's Exempt or Nonexempt classification 
may be changed only upon written notification by the company management. 
 
In addition to the above categories, each Team Member will belong to one other employment 
category: 
 
Full-Time Team Members are those who are not in a temporary or introductory status and who 
are regularly scheduled to work the assigned full-time schedule. Generally, they are eligible for 
the company's benefit package, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit 
program.  
 
Part-Time Team Members are those who are not assigned to a temporary or introductory status 
and who are regularly scheduled to work less than (30) hours per week. While they do receive all 
legally mandated benefits (such as Social Security and workers' compensation insurance), they 
are ineligible for all of the company's other benefit programs.  
 
Probationary Team Members are those whose performance is being evaluated to determine 
whether further employment in a specific position or with Leaders Holding Co™ is appropriate. 
Team Members who satisfactorily complete the probationary period will be notified of their new 
employment classification. 
 
Temporary Team Members are those whose work assignments in this category are of a limited 
duration.  Employment beyond any initially stated period (usually not longer than 6 months) does 
not in any way imply a change in employment status. 
Introductory Period 
The introductory period is intended to give new Team Members the opportunity to demonstrate 
their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new 
position meets their expectations. Leaders Holding Co™ uses this period to evaluate Team 
Member capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. Either the Team Member or the 
company may end the employment relationship at will at any time during or after the introductory 
period, with or without cause or advance notice.
