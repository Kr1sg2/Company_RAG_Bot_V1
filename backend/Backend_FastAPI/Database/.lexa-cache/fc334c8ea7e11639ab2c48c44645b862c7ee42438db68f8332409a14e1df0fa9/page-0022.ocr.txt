When a personal or non-FMLA medical leave ends, the Team Member may be returned to the 
same position, if it is available, or to a similar available position for which the Team Member is 
qualified.  However, Leaders Holding Co™ cannot guarantee reinstatement in all cases.  If a Team 
Member fails to report to work promptly at the expiration of the approved leave period, Leaders 
Holding Co™ will assume the Team Member has resigned. 
Bereavement Leave 
All full-time Team Members who wish to take time off due to the death of an immediate family 
member should notify their supervisor immediately.  Two (2) paid days off for bereavement leave 
will be provided per approved request.   
 
Bereavement leave will normally be granted unless there are unusual business needs or staffing 
requirements.  Team Members may, with their supervisors' approval, use any available paid leave 
for additional time off as necessary.  
 
Leaders Holding Co™ defines "immediate family" as the Team Member's spouse, parent, child, 
sibling, grandparents, grandchildren and comparable in-law or step relation. 
 
Jury Duty 
Leaders Holding Co™ encourages team members to fulfill their civic duty by serving jury duty when 
called upon.  A team member who is summoned to jury duty will be granted paid leave for all 
hours required for such duty, not to exceed 8 hours in a day. 
 
If the jury duty does not require absence for the entire workday, the team member should return 
to their scheduled work immediately upon release by the court.  Any jury fees paid to the team 
member may be kept by the team member. 
 
Team members must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that 
the supervisor may plan to accommodate their absence.  
Time Off to Vote 
Leaders Holding Co™ encourages Team Members to fulfill their civic responsibilities by 
participating in elections.  Generally, Team Members can find time to vote either before or after 
their regular work schedule.   
Crime Victims Leave 
Team Members who have been a victim of certain crimes are able to take up to 3 working days of 
unpaid leave in a 12-month period. Paid Time Off may be substituted for unpaid time under this 
leave. Team Members who take leave must provide sufficient documentation and notice as soon 
as possible.  Please contact your supervisor or Human Resources to request this leave. 
Military Leave (USERRA) 
A military leave of absence will be granted to Team Members who are absent from work because 
of service in the U.S. uniformed services in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment
