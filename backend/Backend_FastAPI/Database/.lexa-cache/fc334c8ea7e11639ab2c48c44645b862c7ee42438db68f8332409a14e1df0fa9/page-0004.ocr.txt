At Will 
Employment with Leaders Holding Co™ is voluntarily entered into, and the Team Member is free 
to resign at will at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the company may terminate the 
employment relationship at will at any time, with or without notice or cause.  
 
THIS TEAM MEMBER HANDBOOK DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A CONTRACT AND SHOULD NOT BE 
CONSTRUED AS A CONTRACT BY ANY TEAM MEMBER.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE 
EMPLOYMENT FOR ANY SPECIFIC DURATION, AND ALL TEAM MEMBERS ARE EMPLOYED ON AN 
“AT WILL” BASIS.   
 
THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND OR MODIFY THESE POLICIES WITH OR 
WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, EXCEPT FOR THE POLICY OF AT WILL EMPLOYMENT. NO STATEMENT BY 
MANAGEMENT MAY BE INTERPRETED AS A CHANGE IN POLICY, NOR MAY IT CONSTITUTE AN 
AGREEMENT.   
 
These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added 
to without the express written approval of the company. 
Equal Employment Opportunity 
Leaders Holding Co™ is committed to having a workplace free of illegal discrimination and 
harassment on the basis of race, color, religion or comparable moral conviction, sex (including 
pregnancy), age, disability, disabled veteran status, marital status, national origin, genetic 
information, and any other status protected by law. 
 
All Team Members are required to refrain from illegal discrimination and harassment, and to 
report any violation of the policy, whether against them or any other person.  Illegal 
discrimination and harassment against Team Members, customers, vendors, and any other 
persons associated with our business is taken very seriously and will not be tolerated. 
 
When our nondiscrimination policies apply: 
Our policies are applicable to any interaction between our Team Members that affects Team 
Members in their work.  This means, for instance, that inappropriate conduct, even when not 
during working hours, taking place outside of the workplace, and/or communicated over private 
channels (such as your mobile phone or home computer) can violate our policies if the effects of 
the conduct are felt by an Team Member at work. 
 
Unlawful harassment: 
Harassment on the basis of any protected status is prohibited (for example, harassment on the 
basis of age, race, religion, national origin, and disability are prohibited), however, our strict 
prohibition of sexual harassment may require additional clarification.  Sexual harassment can 
include any unwelcome requests for sexual favors, touching, comments, gestures, telephone or 
computer communications, or other behavior of a sexual nature, when submitting to such 
conduct is either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment, is used as the basis 
for employment decisions, interferes with someone’s job performance, or creates an intimidating, 
hostile, or offensive working environment.
