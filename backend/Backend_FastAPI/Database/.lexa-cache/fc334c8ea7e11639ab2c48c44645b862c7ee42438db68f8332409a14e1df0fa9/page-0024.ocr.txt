HEALTH AND SAFETY 
To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for Team Members, customers, and 
visitors, Leaders Holding Co™ has established a workplace safety program. This program is a top 
priority for the Company. The President has responsibility for implementing, administering, 
monitoring, and evaluating the safety program. Its success depends on the alertness and personal 
commitment of all. 
 
Leaders Holding Co™ provides information to Team Members about workplace safety and health 
issues through regular internal communication channels such as supervisor-Team Member 
meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications. 
 
Each Team Member is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities. 
Team Members must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor. 
Team Members who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or 
who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, are in clear violation of this 
policy. 
 
In the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, 
Team Members should immediately notify the appropriate supervisor. Such reports are necessary 
to comply with laws and initiate insurance and workers' compensation benefits procedures.  
Depending on the seriousness of the injury, may be referred to the clinic for treatment...  
 
The following is a summary of safety rules; common sense should always be used around 
equipment.  These rules will be enforced and are for the protection of all of us.  Please follow 
them and ask your fellow Team Members to do the same.  Please report any unsafe actions to 
your supervisor.  Discipline for safety violations will depend on the severity of the individual 
violation. 
If recurring safety violations occur, you will be subject to disciplinary actions up to and including 
termination.
