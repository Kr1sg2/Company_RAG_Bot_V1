one of the most addictive substances known today. The crack high is reached in 4-6 seconds and 
lasts about 15 minutes. 
Cocaine 
One of the most dangerous effects of crack is that it can cause vomiting, rapid heartbeat, tremors 
and convulsive movements. All of this muscle activity increases the demand for oxygen, which can 
result in a cocaine induced heart attack. Since the heat-regulating center in the brain is also 
disrupted, dangerously high body temperatures can occur. With high doses, brain functioning, 
breathing and heartbeat are depressed -- leading to death.

D. Amphetamines 
Amphetamines are drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and promote a feeling of 
alertness and an increase in speech and general physical activity. Some common street names for 
amphetamines are speed, uppers, black beauties, bennies, wakeups, footballs, and dexies. People 
with a history of sustained low dose use quite often become dependent and believe they need 
the drug to get by. These users frequently keep taking amphetamines to avoid the “down” mood 
they experience when the “high” wears off. 
Even small, infrequent doses can produce toxic effects in some people. Restlessness, anxiety, 
mood swings, panic, heartbeat disturbances, paranoid thoughts, hallucinations, convulsions, and 
coma have been reported. Long-term users often have acne resembling measles, trouble with 
their teeth, gums and nails, and dry, dull hair. Heavy, frequent doses can produce brain damage 
resulting in speech disturbances.
