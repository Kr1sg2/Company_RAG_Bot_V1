Work Schedules 
Our workweek runs from Monday to Sunday.  Operational demands may necessitate variations in 
starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day 
and week.  Schedule and Team Member assignments are subject to change. 
Meal Periods 
All full-time Team Members are provided with one unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes and 
up to 60 minutes in length each workday.  Supervisors will schedule meal periods to accommodate 
operating requirements.  Team Members will be relieved of all active responsibilities and 
restrictions during meal periods and will not be compensated for that time. 
Rest Breaks 
Team Members may not leave their work areas without the expressed approval of their 
supervisor. All Team Members who work 8 hours during the workday are provided with two rest 
periods of 15 minutes in length. If you are a non-exempt (hourly), Team Member you are not 
permitted to leave company property during your paid rest period. As much as possible, rest 
periods will be provided in the middle of work periods depending on your departmentâ€™s schedule. 
Since this time is counted and paid as time worked, Team Members must not be absent from their 
workstations beyond the allotted 15-minute rest period time.  
Overtime 
When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, Team 
Members may be scheduled to work overtime hours.  When possible, advance notification of 
these mandatory assignments will be provided.  All overtime work must receive the supervisor's 
prior authorization.  Overtime assignments will be distributed as equally as practical to all Team 
Members qualified to perform the required work. 
 
Overtime compensation is paid to all nonexempt Team Members in accordance with federal and 
state wage and hour restrictions.  Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked plus premium 
hours. Time off on vacation leave, holidays, or any leave of absence will not be considered hours 
worked for purposes of performing overtime calculations. 
Absenteeism and Tardiness 
Team Members are expected to be at work on time and to work their full scheduled hours as part 
of the essential functions of their position. Team Members who report late to work or return late 
(more than 5 minutes) from: meal periods, breaks, or leave prior to the end of the workday 
without permission, will be considered tardy.  
 
Repeated absenteeism and/or tardiness will not be tolerated. A Team Member who will be absent 
from work for any reason must communicate with your manager at least one hour before the 
start time of their shift. If you are absent from work without prior authorization or without giving 
proper notice to your supervisor or Human Resources, the Team Member will be considered to 
have voluntarily resigned from the company if they do not contact their supervisor or Human 
Resources department within 48 hours. If a Team Member is absent from work due to illness the
