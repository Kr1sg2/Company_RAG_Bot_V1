SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY-(DOT) 
It is the overall objective of Leaders Holding Co™, also known through this document as The 
Company, to maintain a drug and alcohol-free work force and to eliminate the safety risks, lost 
time and reduced productivity that results from the use of and the influence of alcohol and/or 
drugs in the workplace. The Company will implement this policy and conduct screenings of job 
applicants and Company Team Members for illegal drugs, improper use of prescription drugs and 
alcohol. 
The Company will ensure that testing procedures are conducted in a fair and unbiased manner 
and the rights of applicants subject to testing are protected. The Company will make every effort 
to protect the dignity and self-esteem of those being tested by complying with the standards of 
confidentiality set forth in this policy. The implementation of this program is intended to deter 
the use of drugs and alcohol in the workplace in accordance with the United States Department 
of Transportation (USDOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations 49 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 40 entitled, “Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug 
Testing Programs”, part 382, entitled “Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing”.

accidents, three times as many vehicular accidents, and use three times as much sick time as those 
who do not. To maintain a drug-free work force and to eliminate the safety risks, lost time and 
reduced productivity that results from the use and the influence of alcohol and/or drugs in the 
workplace, the Company has adopted a substance abuse policy.  
The intention of this policy is to make Leaders a safer and better place to work.
