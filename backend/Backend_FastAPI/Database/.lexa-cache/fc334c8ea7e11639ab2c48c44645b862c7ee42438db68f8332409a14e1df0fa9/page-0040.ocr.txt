• 
Pre-employment drug tests are performed on all applicants. Alcohol tests are performed 
on applicants who have received a conditional offer of employment. 
• 
Reasonable suspicion tests are administered when a supervisor has reason to believe a 
Team Member might be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Symptoms suggesting 
drug or alcohol use include visible needle marks, red eyes, liquor smell on breath or 
clothing, sudden changes in work performance, inappropriate behavior, and unexplained 
and/or frequent absenteeism. 
• 
Random tests are performed on Team Members who occupy safety- or health-sensitive 
positions, including transportation positions. 
• 
Post-accident testing is performed where required by law or under this policy. 
• 
Return-to-work testing is performed on Team Members returning from a lengthy job 
absence. 
• 
All test results are kept confidential. If an initial drug test is positive, a confirmation test 
is performed on the same specimen. Team Members who have a confirmed positive test 
result will be referred to assistance programs thought counseling. Cost of these visits will 
be the Team Member’s responsibility.  
 
Team Members who refuse to submit to drug testing are terminated and not eligible for 
reemployment for two years.

assistance program through counseling to help workers deal with substance abuse and other 
problems that they and their families might encounter.  
Team Members who agree to take part in a drug treatment program will not have their 
employment affected unless they fail to complete the required course of treatment or continue 
to use drugs. 
Drug-free awareness education. Leaders Holding Co™ presents a drug-free awareness education 
program to all supervisors and Team Members on a periodic basis. The program covers the 
dangers of drug abuse in the workplace, the availability of counseling and treatment and the 
penalties for violating the substance abuse policy. 
Worker’s Compensation Insurance 
Leaders Holding Co™ provides a comprehensive workers' compensation insurance program at no 
cost to Team Members. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of 
employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment.  Team Members who sustain 
work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. No matter how 
minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately.
