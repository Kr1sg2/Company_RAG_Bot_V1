FMLA Leave Procedure 
 
Notification by Team Members of need for leave.   
The Company cannot know that FMLA leave is needed, and cannot provide FMLA entitlements, 
unless Team Members first appropriately notify the Company of their need for leave in sufficient 
detail for the Company to understand that FMLA leave is appropriate.  If the need to use FMLA 
leave is foreseeable, Team Members must give the company at least 30 days prior notice of the 
need to take leave. When 30 days-notice is not possible, Team Members must give notice as far 
in advance as practicable under the circumstances. In an emergency where advance notice of the 
need for leave cannot be given, Team Members (or their representatives if Team Members are 
medically unable to give notice themselves) are required to notify the Company as soon as 
reasonably practicable.  Failure or unreasonable delay in providing notice may be grounds for 
delaying the start of the FMLA leave and may have other adverse consequences.  
Requests for FMLA leave should be directed to Human Resources using the Request for 
Family/Medical Leave form available from Human Resources.  
When submitting a request for leave, the Team Member must provide sufficient information for 
the Company to determine if the leave might qualify as FMLA leave and provide information on 
the anticipated date when the leave would start as well as the anticipated duration of the leave.  
Team Members also must inform the Company if the requested leave is for a reason for which 
FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. 
  
Notification to Team Members of leave availability   
Once the Company is aware of a request for FMLA leave under the procedures outlined in this 
policy and has received the information it needs, it will inform the requesting Team Member of 
the availability of FMLA leave.  Assuming FMLA leave is available under the circumstances, Team 
Members will be given a written notice that includes details of the leave that is being granted.  If 
FMLA leave is not available, the Company will notify the Team Member.  
 
Medical certification and recertification 
 Team Members who request leave because of their own or a covered relationâ€™s serious health 
condition must supply substantiating medical certification. Team Members may obtain medical 
certification forms from Human Resources.   The Company will inform requesting Team Members 
of when medical certifications must be provided (in any event no more than 15 days after leave 
is requested).  Team Members should plan on providing medical certification prior to taking leave 
where the need for leave is foreseeable.  The Company may require subsequent medical 
recertification. Failure to provide requested recertification within 15 days, except in extraordinary 
circumstances, may result in the delay of further FMLA leave (meaning that interim leave may not 
be protected by the FMLA).  Team Members taking FMLA leave for their own serious health 
condition may also be required to provide a fitness-for-duty certification upon return to work, 
including during intermittent leave.  
 
Exception for highly compensated Team Members 
 The company may deny FMLA leave to highly compensated Team Members if it determines that 
granting FMLA leave would result in substantial economic injury to the company.  This 
determination is made on a case-by-case basis.  For purposes of the FMLA, highly compensated
