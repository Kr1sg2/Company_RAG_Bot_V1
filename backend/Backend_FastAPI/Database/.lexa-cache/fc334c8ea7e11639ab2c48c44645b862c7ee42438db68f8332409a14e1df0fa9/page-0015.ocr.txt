and a professional counselor is available to help you when you need it.  
LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) 
Pursuant to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Company provides leave to 
eligible Team Members if the Company employed 50 or more Team Members in 20 or more 
workweeks in the current or preceding year (if the Company does not meet this threshold in a 
given year, the FMLA, including the policies described in this section, does not apply).  While the 
company reserves the right to grant leave on terms and conditions in excess of those required by 
law, nothing herein shall be construed to require the Company to do so, and such leave will not 
be subject to the protections of the FMLA. 
 
An FMLA-Eligible Team Member is a Team Member who meets the following criteria: 
•The Team Member has accrued 12 months of service with the Company within the previous 
seven years. 
•The Team Member has worked at least 1,250 hours for the Company during the 12-month period 
immediately prior to taking FMLA leave; and 
•The Team Member works at a location where at least 50 Team Members are employed by the 
Company within a 75-mile radius. 
 
Reasons for taking family/medical leave 
Family/medical leave may be taken for the following reasons: 
• 
The Team Member’s incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care, or childbirth. 
• 
To care for the Team Member’s child after birth, or placement of a child with the Team 
Member for adoption or foster care. 
 
• To care for the Team Member’s spouse, child, or parent (each a “qualified family 
member”) who has a serious health condition; or  
• For a serious health condition of the Team Member that renders the Team Member 
unable to perform an essential function of his or her position.  A serious health condition 
is an illness, injury, or impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an 
overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a health care provider 
for a condition that either prevents the Team Member from performing the essential 
functions of the Team Member’s job or prevents the qualified family member from 
participating in school or other daily activities.  Subject to certain conditions, the 
continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than 
three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care 
provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to 
pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition.  Other conditions may also meet the 
definition of continuing treatment. 
 
Child/Parent relationship 
For purposes of FMLA leave because of the birth of a son or daughter, in order to care for such 
son or daughter, because of the placement of a son or daughter with the Team Member for 
adoption or foster care, and to care for a son or daughter with a serious health condition, a child
