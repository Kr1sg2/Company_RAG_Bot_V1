ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) 
It is recognized that Team Members may experience either a temporary or permanent 
impairment, which may impact their ability to perform the requirements of their job duties. 
The company will provide reasonable accommodations for Team Members that would allow them 
to continue to perform the essential functions of their position, and which do not impose an 
undue hardship on the business. 
Any Team Member having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more 
of his or her major life activities and which impacts their ability to perform their job duties, should 
notify their supervisor and the Human Resources Department. 
Lactation Accommodation 
In compliance with federal law, the company will provide appropriate private, secure areas, other 
than a restroom, for Team Members to express milk within the year after a child’s birth.  If your 
location does not have a regularly designated area and you do not have a private office that you 
can use for this purpose, ask your manager to designate an appropriate place.  Team Members 
may take breaks of a reasonable length for this purpose.   Hourly Team Members may take up to 
20 minutes at a time, three times per day for this purpose without clocking out, provided that any 
other paid break time (for instance if they are normally allowed smoking breaks) should be set off 
against time taken for this purpose.  Longer or more frequent breaks should be off the clock 
(unpaid).  Note, however, that many jurisdictions have policies on lactation breaks; if you are in a 
jurisdiction that provides a higher standard of accommodation for lactation, the higher standard 
will apply.  Please contact Human Resources with any questions pertaining to this policy. 
 
Dispute Resolution 
The laws of the State of Florida shall govern any disputes between Leaders Holding Co™ and the 
Team Member.  The forum selected for any proceeding or suit related to a dispute between 
Leaders and the Team Member shall be in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction 
located in Hillsborough County, Florida or Pinellas County, Florida.  Team Member consents to 
said courts’ jurisdiction over it and waives any defense, that Hillsborough County, Florida or 
Pinellas County, Florida is an improper or inconvenient venue.
