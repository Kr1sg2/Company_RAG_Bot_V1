When approved, the actual costs of travel, meals, lodging, and other expenses directly related to 
accomplishing business travel objectives will be paid by Leaders Holding Co™.   
 
Team Members who are involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report 
the incident to their immediate supervisor.  Vehicles owned, leased, or rented by Leaders Holding 
Co™ may not be used for personal use without prior approval.  
 
Non-Exempt Team Members who travel as part of their normal workday will be compensated for 
time spent traveling. Non-Exempt Team Members who travel away from home overnight will be 
compensated for time spent engaged in company business even if such time occurs outside 
normal working hours. Time spent driving a vehicle due to travel requirements for company 
business during normal work hours will count as work time. 
 
Team Members should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related 
to travel arrangements, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses, or any other 
business travel issues. 
Company Property and Vehicles 
All items produced by Leaders Holding Co™ are the sole property of the company and its 
customers. There is no condition or situation that will allow a Team Member to take company 
property for personal use.  The repercussions of such actions can ruin the company’s reputation 
and cause irrefutable damage.  
 
 It is the company’s policy that company owned vehicles are to be used by Team Members only, 
including drivers and passengers, unless otherwise advised by the President. 
 
Please be advised that all Team Members who are provided with or use a Company vehicle are 
covered under the Company’s automobile insurance program while operating that vehicle.  
However, this coverage does not apply whenever you are operating any other vehicle or are a 
passenger in another vehicle.  Allowing unauthorized passengers in company owned vehicles is a 
direct violation of the company’s insurance policy as well as Company policy.  
 
Detailed mileage and receipt logs must be kept for all vehicles. Should a Team Member lose 
his/her license because of traffic violations, or should our insurance carrier specifically exclude 
coverage for a particular driver due to his specific traffic violations, that Team Member is in direct 
violation of the company policy.  It is the Team Member’s responsibility to notify his/her 
supervisor or Human Resources immediately if his/her driver’s license is revoked or suspended.  
Additionally, anyone observing violation of this policy is required to report this infraction to their 
supervisor or Human Resources immediately. 
Personal Vehicles 
Team Members who will be required to use personal vehicles to travel between assignments must 
provide up to date insurance and driver’s license information.  As specified by the company’s 
insurance carrier, Team Members who use their personal vehicle for official company business 
must have proof of insurance and be able to meet the minimum requirements as set forth by the 
insurance carrier.
