Accommodation of disabilities: 
If you have a disability that impacts your ability to perform your job, speak with the appropriate 
member of management at the corporate office regarding whether a reasonable accommodation 
may be available to help you perform the essential functions of your job.  You’re providing 
information (which may include information from medical providers) and cooperating with 
attempts to find reasonable accommodation is essential. 
 
Reporting and resolving discrimination and harassment concerns: 
 
Illegal Harassment and discrimination cannot be eliminated without your help; it is everyone’s 
responsibility.  If you believe you are being illegally discriminated against or harassed, tell the 
person who is harassing or discriminating against you what behavior you want to stop and why.  
Also, if you believe that illegal discrimination or harassment has occurred or is occurring (whether 
you or anyone else are the victim), immediately report it to your supervisor.  If you do not receive 
a satisfactory resolution, continue to report it up the chain of authority -- all the way to the 
President, if necessary.  If you are not reasonably able to approach a particular person in the chain 
of authority (for instance, if you believe your supervisor is sexually harassing or discriminating 
against you), skip a level and go to the next person in the chain.   
 
Open door policy: 
All supervisors and managers maintain an “open door” policy to listen to Team Member concerns 
about potential illegal discrimination and harassment.  You may bring these concerns up at any 
time. 
 
No retaliation: 
You have the right to complain of illegal discrimination and harassment without retaliation.  As 
long as you act in good faith (for instance, by telling the whole truth to the best of your ability and 
cooperating with any investigations), no adverse employment action will be taken against you for 
complaining about illegal discrimination or harassment. If you feel you are being improperly 
retaliated against, report it following the same procedures you would follow to complain of illegal 
discrimination or harassment.  Remember, just as you have a right to bring these matters up, you 
also have a responsibility to do so; if you do not bring them up, they cannot be addressed.  
Because we prohibit retaliation, there is never a good excuse for failing to report discrimination 
or harassment. 
 
What happens when a complaint is made? 
If a complaint about potential illegal discrimination, harassment or retaliation is made, The 
Company will promptly investigate the complaint.  Investigations will be done with due respect 
for all involved.  All Team Members are required to cooperate in investigations including by telling 
the whole truth to the best of their knowledge, attending interviews with investigators appointed 
by the company, providing all information (including any physical items such as documents or 
notes) they may have, and maintaining confidentiality.  The obligation to cooperate extends to 
both persons making a complaint and to anyone else the company feels may have information 
relevant to an investigation.  If an investigation results in a finding that Leaders Holding Co™ ’s 
policies forbidding illegal discrimination and harassment have been violated, the company will 
take action intended to prevent any further violations.
