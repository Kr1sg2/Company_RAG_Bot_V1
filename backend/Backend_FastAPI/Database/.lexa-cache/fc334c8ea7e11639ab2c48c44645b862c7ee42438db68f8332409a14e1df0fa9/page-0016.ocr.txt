will be considered the Team Member’s if he or she is the biological, adopted, or foster child, 
stepchild, or legal ward of the Team Member, or if the Team Member stands in loco parentis, and 
the child is (A) under 18 years of age; or (B) 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care 
because of a mental or physical disability.  There is no limit on the number of parents a son or 
daughter may have for purposes of such FMLA leave. 
 
An Team Member may be in loco parentis even if the Team Member has no biological or legal 
relationship to the child, if the Team Member assumes (or, in the case of birth or other prospective 
relationships, intends to assume) obligations incident to the parental relation as a practical matter 
(note that temporary arrangements for convenience, such as babysitting while parents take a 
vacation, are not sufficient to be in loco parentis for FMLA purposes).  Factors that will be 
considered in determining whether an Team Member is in loco parentis include, but may not be 
limited to, the age of the child, the degree to which the child is dependent on the Team Member, 
the amount of support (if any) the Team Member provides, and the extent to which duties 
commonly associated with parenthood are exercised by the Team Member (for example, an Team 
Member who houses and cares for a grandchild because the child’s parents are unable to do so, 
or an Team Member who shares in the upbringing of a child in the Team Member’s household 
who is the son or daughter of the Team Member’s life partner, regardless of whether that 
partnership is legally recognized, may be in loco parentis).  Team Members may be required to 
provide written statements or other reasonable information establishing that children for whom 
they seek FMLA leave are their sons or daughters as defined by this policy. 
 
Amount of family/medical leave available 
Eligible Team Members may take up to 12 weeks of family/medical leave within a rolling 12-
month period. A 12-month period is measured backward from the date a Team Member last used 
family or medical leave. 
 
Military Family Leave under the FMLA 
There are two types of Military Family Leave available under the FMLA; Qualifying Exigency leave 
and Military Caregiver leave.  
 
Qualifying Exigency leave under the FMLA 
Eligible Team Members may take up to a total of 12 work weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying 
exigencies arising out of the fact that Team Member’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on 
covered active duty, or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty, in 
support of a foreign country or contingency operation.  Qualifying exigency leave is available to a 
family member of a military member in the Armed Forces including the National Guard or 
Reserves.  
Covered active duty under the FMLA means: 
In the case of a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment 
of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country; and 
In the case of a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment 
of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty 
under a provision of law referred to in Section 101(a)(13)B) of Title 10, United States Code.
