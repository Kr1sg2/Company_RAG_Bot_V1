• 
Saying negative things about the Company, our clients, your coworkers, or the people and 
companies that do business with us. 
• 
Disclosing information about the Company, our clients, your coworkers, or the people and 
companies that do business with us that is not normally shared with the general public, 
whether or not you understand it to be technically confidential (you should generally assume 
any such information is confidential unless advised otherwise by a supervisor and authorized 
to make a specific disclosure). 
• 
Making statements as if you were speaking on the Company’s behalf (unless you have been 
specifically authorized to do so); if there is a possibility of confusion you should make clear 
that you are speaking on your own behalf, not the Company’s. 
• 
Speaking to the press about the Company or matters relating to the Company. 
• 
Endorsing or promoting the Company’s products and/or services without making proper 
disclosures (for instance, pretending to be a customer writing a positive review online); check 
with your supervisor for guidance on promotional activities before undertaking them. 
• 
Engaging in harassing, insulting, criminal, or other harmful or offensive speech or conduct in 
a way that could be attributed to, reflect on, or negatively impact the Company. 
 
Be aware that, once a statement is made, you may not be able to predict or control where it goes, 
nonetheless, you will be held responsible for it.  For example, you may say something to a friend 
in an email and assume that it will go no further, but it could from there be spread through the 
internet without your knowledge and consent, and if the statement is found to have been a 
breach of your duty to the Company, you may be disciplined for it.  As another example, you may 
make a statement in a blog that you believe is anonymous or not relatable to the Company, but 
your affiliation with the Company might be discovered through information about you readily 
available on the internet (such as profiles on social networking sites) and your connection with 
the Company will be known, even though you had not intended it to be in connection with your 
statement.  Your statement remains your responsibility even though you may have intended to 
make it anonymously. 
 
Nothing in the Company’s policies is intended to prevent you from exercising your legal rights.  
For example, if you wish to contact a government agency with a concern about matters such as 
(but not limited) discrimination, harassment, safety, or wages, or if you are asked to participate 
in a government investigation, our policies do not prohibit you from doing so.  You are also 
encouraged to raise any such concerns through appropriate channels within the Company as 
provided in our policies.
