Outside Employment 
Team Members may hold outside jobs as long as they meet the performance standards of their 
job with the company.  All Team Members will be judged by the same performance standards and 
will be subject to company scheduling demands, regardless of any outside work requirements. 
Team Members should request approval from their supervisor before accepting outside 
employment.  
 
If Leaders Holding Co™ determines that a Team Member's outside work interferes with 
performance or the ability to meet the requirements of Leaders Holding Co™ as they are modified 
from time to time, the Team Member may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he 
or she wishes to remain with the company.

immediately to your supervisor; this may lead to dismissal from your job at Leaders Holding Co™.

receive any income or material gain from individuals outside Leaders Holding Co™ for materials 
produced or services rendered while performing their jobs.
