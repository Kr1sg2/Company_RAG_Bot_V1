Cushions – What to use 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the cushion on end to 
allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the frame and the 
cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy solution of 
mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  
Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE SEAMS 
OF THE CASE. 
If, and only if your cushion is made from 100% solution-dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may use 1-
part bleach mixed with 1-part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a small 
inconspicuous spot for colorfastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse the cushion 
thoroughly to remove all the bleach solution.

*From date of delivery is defined as the delivery when the product was first delivered to the purchaser.  It does not include any subsequent delivery for any 
additional item(s) or item(s) replaced under warranty.  Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for five years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of 
these mills and the mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make you new covers for your cushions.  If you would like 
complete new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade.
