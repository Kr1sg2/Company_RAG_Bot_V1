Windy Conditions 
Safety Warning!  During windy conditions, chaise lounge and recliner headrests may be blown forward, possibly 
resulting in head, neck, facial, arm and/or back injuries.  During windy conditions the headrests must be lowered to 
the fully down position. The use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be discontinued and users should leave 
the area.  
Notice for contract installations: Include the following or substantially similar conspicuous written 
notice as part of the posted Rules and Regulations at poolside, and elsewhere wherever chaise 
lounges and recliners are available for use: "During windy conditions, the use of the chaise 
lounges and recliners must be discontinued and users should leave the area."  
Consider also including such notice in the written material(s) provided to guests in connection 
with the availability and use of the guest amenities at your facility. 
Cleaning and Care 
Care - Preventative Maintenance 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to clean does 
not mean that it will not get dirty in an outdoor environment.  A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in 
to keeping your new furnishings looking new, longer. 
Regular periodic care of your outdoor furniture will help maintain its appearance and functionality better than 
occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider the specific conditions and usage to which your product is exposed, 
so appropriate maintenance can be planned.  
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. Regular cleaning of outdoor furniture will 
help to prevent its forming.  Do not place flower pots or any items on the furniture that will leave stains.  Do not 
place hot items directly onto resin furniture to avoid discoloration. 
Covers 
Covers can be purchased for at a great price for any size furniture or table including sectionals and fire 
pits.  Using a good quality weather proof breathable cover to cover your purchase while you are out of 
town, while the leaves are dropping, through pollen season, or through seasonal rains will not only reduce 
the amount of cleaning you have to do to keep your furniture looking new, it will also reduce your use and 
exposure to cleaning agents.  Please send us an e-mail if we can help you with selecting and purchasing 
covers at solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com 
Corrosion Block® 
Corrosion Block® was a product developed specifically for the marine and aviation industry to protect 
aluminum.  When used as part of your regular furniture maintenance program it will ensure you get 
the maximum life out of your outdoor furniture.  Leader’s Casual Furniture® is an authorized Corrosion 
Block® dealer.  Please see your local store or our website to order. 
NOTE:  Corrosion Block® works fantastic on stainless appliances in your home or your outdoor kitchen 
Application is Easy: 
Spray Corrosion Block® onto a rag and wipe the painted metal surface.  Do not spray Corrosion Block 
directly onto the surface from the can.  Over application will make your furniture feel wet and slippery.
