Garden Classics Ownership Packet 
2/12/2018 
Introduction 
Since 1971 we have been designing and manufacturing comfortable outdoor living products that are 
made to last in the sun and by the sea.  We only use tested materials that are produced to last in harsh 
outdoor seaside conditions.  However, even these durable designs need periodic care.  It is because of 
our policy of only using high quality materials, your Garden Classics® furniture will be easy to own. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Whether it is hand woven wicker, artisan carved original molds for cast aluminum or the 25 step 
hand painted process to make fiberglass, concrete, and aluminum look like wood, we put the 
time and effort into each piece to give it a look that will compliment your space. 
Hardware 
 
All of our hardware is stainless steel.  If you live near the salty ocean air, relax, your Garden 
Classics® is made to last. 
Material 
 
We hand select the materials that go into each piece.  All of our hardware is 360 stainless steel 
or better.  Structural frames are all powder coated aluminum.  Cast aluminum is all made of high 
quality alloy.  The UV stable synthetic wicker used must pass a 4 year accelerated UV test and 
show no signs of change in color, surface texture, or strength.  
Construction 
 
We continually learn and take steps to make our furniture better than any other outdoor 
furniture manufacturer.  We use thicker aluminum in our frames, we pay more for our material 
to have higher UV resistance, and we add reinforcement that will never be seen to the places 
that need it most.  All of our products are sold to restaurants and hotels with the exact same 
construction as the products we sell for your home.  Our goal is to make product so durable that 
you have to give it away before you buy your next set because it is still in great shape.
