Turtle Wax Ice or other Spray Wax 
Automotive wax has changed a lot from the paste that came in a jar.  You can now 
spray clear protective polymer on to a surface and easily wipe it off with very little 
effort.  This will keep the surface protected from UV fading and from surface 
contact with salt, chlorine and dirt commonly in the air of a back yard setting.  
Make applying spray wax to your aluminum, fiberglass, resin, and synthetic wicker 
surfaces a regular part of your maintenance routine and you will not only have the 
best looking outdoor space in your neighborhood, your purchase will outlast 
everyone else’s as well. 
Coastal Exposure 
Living the coastal lifestyle is a dream for many.  Living the dream and living near the saltwater 
can be a challenge for anything left outside.  The salt in the humid air takes a toll on everything 
from the exterior of your home and your car, to your outdoor furniture.  The best preventative 
maintenance you can do for your outdoor furniture while living near the coast is to rinse it 
regularly with a hose to remove the salt and apply corrosion block to all metal surfaces and 
painted metal surface quarterly.  Any nonmetal surface should be sprayed quarterly with Turtle 
Wax Ice following the directions on the bottle. 
Cleaning - What to Use 
Frames 
Nothing is better than a periodic rinse and if necessary using car wash soap or dish soap and a 
sponge to remove soiling.  If your frames require a more thorough cleaning the best product to use 
for soiling is Mean Green® or Simple Green®.  If you have mold and mildew stains you can use up to 
straight bleach on all Garden Classics® frames.  Please be careful to use appropriate protection and 
to protect clothing and other fabrics in the area. 
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the cushion on 
end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the 
frame and the cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy 
solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse 
thoroughly with fresh water.  Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE SEAMS OF 
THE CASE. 
If and only if your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may 
use 1 part bleach mixed with 1 part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a 
small inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse 
the cushion thoroughly to remove all of the bleach solution.
