*Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of these mills and the mill finds the fabric to 
be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make you new covers for your cushions.  If you would like complete new cushions made, 
you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade.
