OBTAINING WARRANTY SERVICE
Please contact your retail store or point of purchase for assistance in filing a claim. The retailer in turn will file a written claim with TV

customer service department prior to the return of any merchandise. The purchaser may be required to provide a photograph of any 
defective parts. In some circumstances an authorized inspection of the installation may be required. After TV receives the authorized 
return Trivantage will inspect the frame part, motor, or fabric to determine the validity of the warranty claim. The dealer will be notified of 
the warranty claim status. If a Solair dealer is not available the purchaser should contact Trivantage through help@solair.com Labor cost 
for removal and reinstallation of the awning and/or parts shall be the sole responsibility of the purchaser.
