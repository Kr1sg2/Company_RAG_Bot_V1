Button Is Still In Cushion 
If the cover is coming off a button or the button is loose there is a good chance the front and back button are still 
attached by the internal retaining string.  If they are, no tools are required for the button replacement. 
 
 
Fabric is coming off of the aluminum shell of the button 
Practice First 
1. Attaching String 
The included string tied in a loop is for practice only.  Before removing the attached nylon button from the string 
inside the cushion it is suggested that you practice several times to understand and feel how the hook on the 
back of the button works.  Hold the string in one hand and the nylon button in the other hand.  Place the string 
in the notch on the open side of the hook on the button and pull it into the slot. 
 
2. Removing String 
Hold the string in one hand and the nylon button in the other.  Turn the top of the string that goes over the 
nylon hook and push it down to the slot with your thumb and pull.  The string should pop loose.
