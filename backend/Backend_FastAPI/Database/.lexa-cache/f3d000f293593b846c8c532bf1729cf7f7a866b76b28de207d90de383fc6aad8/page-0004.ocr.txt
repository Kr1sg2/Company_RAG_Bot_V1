Chaise Lounge Seat 
1. Remove the nylon end caps from the foot of each sling rail channel 
with a flat bladed screwdriver and a mallet. Retain the end caps. 
Some chaises don’t have end caps at the foot – tilt the headrest 
fully forward and remove the end caps from the other end of the 
sling rails. 
2. On one sling rail, use a 3/16" Allen wrench to remove the two 
socket head cap screws (bolts) towards the foot of the sling rail so 
it can be slightly angled towards the attached sling rail. On the 
other sling rail, loosen two bolts from the foot end of the sling rail 
until only a few threads remain engaged. Some chaises have one 
welded sling rail - remove the bolted rail only. 
3. Use pliers to slide the sling out from the sling rails. You will need to 
alternate pulling between each side several inches at a time. 
4. Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or 
biodegradable liquid soap at the sling insertion point of each sling 
rail to ease installation. 
5. Position the new seat sling so the production tag and/or law labels 
will be at the foot of the chaise and the finished side of the sling is 
facing forward.  Slide the vinyl splines (plastic rods) within the 
fabric to be even with the end of the fabric where it will touch the 
two remaining end caps. 
6. Slowly slide both sides of the sling into the sling rail channel using 
pliers until the sling reaches both end caps. You will need to 
alternate pulling on each side. 
7. Have a second person position the detached sling rail to be 
reattached. Reinstall the bolt and washer/spacer in the foot area, 
only tightening a few turns. Reinstall the bolt and washer/spacer in 
the back seat area. Fully tighten both bolts in this sling rail.
