Replacing Cushions 
Cushions can be replaced to update the appearance of your 
Tropitone® furniture and beautify your outdoor living areas. Tropitone® 
offers replacement cushions to match all current and many discontinued 
frame styles. You may select cushion fabric from our extensive fabric 
offering, or we can use your own material. All our cushions feature 
quality polyester fill and/or foam. The fill is designed to dry quickly and 
retain its loft during use. Contact your local Tropitone® Residential 
Dealer or Commercial Sales Representative for cushion styles, fabric 
selection and pricing. To purchase, you will need to know the model 
numbers for the pieces on which you want to replace cushions. Refer to 
your original sales receipt for this information. 
Replacing Slings 
Slings can be replaced to create a fresh look or to repair your 
Tropitone® furniture by following these simple directions. To order 
replacement slings from your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or 
Commercial Sales Representative, you will need to know the model 
numbers for the pieces you want to re-sling. Refer to your original sales 
receipt for this information.

Safety Warning! Use safety glasses to protect your eyes. 
Hint: Observe washer or spacer placement as hardware is 
removed, so hardware can be reinstalled properly. 
1. Use a utility knife to cut the entire length of the sling. 
2. Remove the nylon end caps from the top and bottom of both sling 
rail channels with a flat bladed screwdriver and a mallet. Retain 
the end caps. 
3. Use a 3/16" Allen wrench to loosen the two socket head cap 
screws (bolts) on one sling rail until only a few threads are 
engaged. Some chairs have one welded sling rail - loosen the 
bolted rail only.  
4. Remove the spreader bar (some have a 90º bend on one end to 
“hook” into the sling rail) from the upper back of the chair.
