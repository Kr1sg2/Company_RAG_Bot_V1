8. On the other sling rail, tighten each bolt several turns using the 
Allen wrench, alternating between each bolt to apply even tension. 
Continue until all bolts are fully tightened. 
9. Trim excess vinyl spline from both sling rails.  
10. Reinsert the end caps. Tap gently with the mallet until fully 
inserted. 
Chaise Lounge Headrest 
Hint: Place the headrest sling in the sun to warm the fabric 
which will allow the material stretch during installation.  
1. With the headrest in a down position, use a utility knife to cut the 
entire length of the headrest sling. 
2. Remove the nylon end caps from the top of each sling rail channel 
with a flat bladed screwdriver and a mallet. Retain the end caps. 
3. With the headrest in a down position, use pliers to pull the sling out 
from the sling rails. 
4. Remove one socket head cap screw (bolt) in the support bar. 
Loosen the other bolt in the support bar (some are welded on one 
side – detach other side only). Gently angle the detached side of 
the support bar below the sling rail; you may need to use a large 
screwdriver to pry the bar out of its position. This will allow the 
sling rails to be slightly angled together.  
5. Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or 
biodegradable liquid soap at the sling insertion point of each sling 
rail to ease installation. 
6. Position the new headrest sling so the finished side of the sling is 
facing forward.  For padded headrest slings, check for an 
additional finishing sew line at one end of the sling –orient this end 
of the sling to the top of the chaise.  Slide the vinyl splines (plastic 
rods) within the fabric to be even with the end of the fabric where it 
will touch the two remaining end caps. 
7. Slowly slide both sides of the sling into the sling rail channel using 
pliers until the sling reaches both end caps. You will need to 
alternate pulling on each side. 
8. A sling tool can be helpful at this step (available for purchase from 
your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Commercial Sales 
Representative). Using two persons, reposition the headrest 
support bar which will pull the sling tight. Pry between slide rail and 
the support bar while the to second person moves the support bar 
inside the sling rails. Align the hole in the support bar with the hole
