 Two hole style: Disconnect one sling rail to remove the 
spreader bar, then reinstall the sling rail by only putting bolts 
and washers/spacers until only a few threads are engaged.  
 Slot style: This style spreader bar has a slot on one side – lift 
up through the slot and remove. 
5. Use pliers to slide the sling out from the sling rails, pulling the sling 
down and out to the front of the chair.  
6. Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or liquid 
biodegradable soap at the sling insertion point (top) of each sling 
rail to ease installation. 
7. For one piece slings, position the sling so the production tag 
and/or law label will be at the foot of the chair and the finished side 
of the sling is facing forward. Start at the top of the loosened sling 
rail and slowly slide the sling along the sling rail channel using 
pliers. 
8. After sliding the first side of the sling onto the loosened sling rail, 
detach this sling rail from the chair frame. 
9. Have a second person hold the disconnected sling rail on which 
you have installed the sling. Use pliers to firmly and slowly slide 
the remaining side of the sling into the other sling rail. Reminder: 
the bolts should already be loosened on this sling rail. 
10. Pull the sling down a couple inches on the disconnected rail. Insert 
the spreader bar straight end (non-hook) in the attached sling rail 
hole.  
 Two hole style: Have a second person help by firmly 
stretching the sling rails apart and then slightly rotating the 
detached rail. Insert the hook end of spreader bar into the 
hole. This may take a few tries – take your time with this step. 
 Slot style: After inserting the spreader bar into the attached 
sling rail hole, lower the other end into the slot. 
11. Pull the sling evenly up and down to the ends of both sling rails. 
12. A sling tool can be helpful at this step (available for purchase from 
your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Commercial Sales 
Representative). Have a second person position the detached 
sling rail to be attached, aligning the bolt holes. Reinstall the bolt 
and washer/spacer in the front seat area, only tightening a few 
turns. Reinstall the bolt and washer/spacer in the back seat area. 
Fully tighten both bolts in this sling rail. 
13. On the other sling rail, tighten each bolt several turns using the 
Allen wrench, alternating between each bolt to apply even tension. 
Continue until both bolts are fully tightened.
