distribution of thousands of products everyday.  Leader's Casual Furniture® inventory is tracked 
in real time through a state of the art warehouse management system.  At any given time a piece 
of merchandise can be located anywhere in the company including any of the retail locations. 
Over the years many productive decisions have been made.  Leader’s has evolved into one of the
