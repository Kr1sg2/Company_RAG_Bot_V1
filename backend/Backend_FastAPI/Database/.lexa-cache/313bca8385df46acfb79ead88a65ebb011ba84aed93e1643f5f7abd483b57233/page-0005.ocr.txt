Cleaning – Preventative Maintenance 
All wood is a natural material subject to changes in the environment. The look and feel of natural wood 
is part of the appeal of owning wood garden furniture. Although Ipe is naturally stable, small checks in 
the wood surface may appear if the furniture is placed in dry or sunny environments. Superficial 
checking in no way affects the structural integrity and longevity of your furniture. In full sun, Ipe will 
naturally- weather to a silver gray. 
Cleaning and Care 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  
Easy to clean does not mean that it will not get dirty in an outdoor environment.  A little 
preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping your new furnishings looking new, longer. 
Regular periodic care of your outdoor furniture will help maintain its appearance and 
functionality better than occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider the specific conditions 
and usage to which your product is exposed, so appropriate maintenance can be planned. 
 
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. Regular cleaning of 
outdoor furniture will help to prevent its forming.  Do not place flower pots or any items on the 
furniture that will leave stains.  Do not place hot items directly onto resin furniture to avoid 
discoloration. 
Covers 
Covers can be purchased at a great price for any size furniture or table including sectionals and 
fire pits.  Using a good quality, weather proof, breathable cover for your purchase whether you 
are out of town, while the leaves are dropping, through pollen season, or through seasonal rains 
will not only reduce the amount of cleaning you have to do to keep your furniture looking new, 
it will also reduce the use and exposure to cleaning agents.  Please send us an e-mail if we can 
help you with selecting and purchasing covers at solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com. 
What to Use 
Frames 
Clean with Brightener to prepare the timber for Penofin Verde or clean all wood 
with a mild dish soap and water.  Be certain to allow the wood to dry 
completely.  Paying close attention to follow all of the directions on the can, 
apply Penofin Verde. Wipe off any excess with a smooth rag. For best results, 
once the wood is completely dry, apply a second coat. Wipe off excess a second 
time. 
 
Wood Shield 
Wood Shield is highly recommended as a final step. The light, clear solution operates to protect 
the tabletop and seating arms from water and food stains.  After the above has been completed, 
you will only need to apply Penofin Verde on clean surfaces as needed. 
Optional Wood Cleaner 
This product can be purchased for deeper cleaning issues in lieu of Brightener or mild dish soap.
