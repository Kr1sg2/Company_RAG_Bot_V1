2016-2019 Jensen Leisure Ownership Packet 
7/3/2019 
Introduction 
Ipe (Pronounced “EE-pay”) has been known in Europe as a premium furniture, outdoor decking and 
flooring wood for over 200 years.  Ipe trees are at least 100 years old when they are harvested and the 
large diameter of the logs allows Jensen to manufacture its furniture with 100% solid heartwood.  All 
Jensen Leisure furniture is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, an organization that 
monitors and regulates the forests to preserve ecosystems, biodiversity, and water quality; that respects 
the rights of workers, indigenous peoples, and forest dependent communities; and that is lawful and 
economically viable over the long term. 
The Difference 
Material 
Wood 
A strikingly beautiful timber, Jensen Ipe weathers with strength and elegance. Ipe is incredibly 
strong and dense, with very high wear durability. A handsome chocolate brown when new, the 
sun gracefully transforms Ipe to a mature, elegant silver patina.  Ipe wood is also two times 
denser, heavier and harder than Teak, making its durability unmatched when it comes to natural 
wood. 
Weave 
All weather quality Virofiber is artistically handcrafted using a twisted, traditional basket weave 
onto a powder coated, commercial grade aluminum frame. The natural 
textured weave combines handsomely with the smooth, brown richness of 
Ipe timber arms and base.
