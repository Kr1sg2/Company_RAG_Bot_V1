Cleaning - What to Use 
Frames 
Nothing is better than a periodic rinse and, if necessary, using car wash soap or dish soap and a sponge to 
remove soiling.  If your frames require a more thorough cleaning one of the best products to use for soiling 
Simple Green®.  If you have mold and mildew stains, you can use up to straight bleach on all Garden Classics® 
frames.  Please be careful to use appropriate protection and to protect clothing and other fabrics in the area. 
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet, it is best to stand the cushion on end to allow 
them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the frame and the cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy solution of mild 
detergent (for example, Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  
Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE SEAMS OF THE 
CASINGS. 
If, and only if, your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may use 1-part 
bleach mixed with 1-part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a small inconspicuous spot 
for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse the cushion thoroughly to remove all the 
bleach solution.
