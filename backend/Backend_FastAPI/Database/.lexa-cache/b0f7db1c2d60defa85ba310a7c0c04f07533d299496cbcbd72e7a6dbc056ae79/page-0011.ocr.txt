*Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of these mills and the 
mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make the new covers for your cushions.  If you 
would like completely new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade. 
Dye lot variation results in color differences from bolt to bolt and may not match your fabric swatch or previous shipments.
