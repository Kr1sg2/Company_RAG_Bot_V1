The Difference 
Frames 
All Tropitone® extruded aluminum furniture frames feature a welded, all aluminum frame 
construction and uses full circumference welding in all load bearing joints since it is the 
strongest way to join two pieces of aluminum.  Some collections may feature frames that 
are either solid cast aluminum or a combination of cast and extruded aluminum. Cast to 
extruded material connections have a deep penetrating weld design to insure superior 
strength. 
 
Finishes 
Pre-wash/Pre-finish 
o All Tropitone® casual furniture is prepared for our powder coated finish in a multi-step wash process 
which both cleans the frame and also applies a special finish-bonding agent. This ensures that the 
powder coating will adhere uniformly. 
o powder coating 
o Tropitone® durable polyurethane or polyurethane/polyester blend powder coating is significantly 
thicker than paint. It is applied electrostatically as a powder and then baked at temperatures 
exceeding 400° F.  This causes the powder to melt and flow evenly all around the frame. 
 
Fabric and Fills 
Tropitone outdoor cushions are constructed of fabrics containing UV and mildew inhibitors. Additionally, each 
cushion is constructed of a mildew resistant core of self-draining fills, which is then wrapped in a water resistant 
covering. All Tropitone® fabrics, fill and foam are flame retardant, meeting fire code rating CA117.
