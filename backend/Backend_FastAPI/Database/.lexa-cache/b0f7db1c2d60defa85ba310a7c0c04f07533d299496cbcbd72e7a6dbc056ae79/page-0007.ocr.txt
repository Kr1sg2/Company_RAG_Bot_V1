Windy Conditions 
Safety Warning!  During windy conditions, chaise lounge and recliner headrests may be blown forward, possibly 
resulting in head, neck, facial, arm and/or back injuries.  During windy conditions the headrests must be lowered to the 
fully down position. The use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be discontinued, and users should leave the area. 
Notice for contract installations: Include the following or substantially similar conspicuous written notice as part of the 
posted Rules and Regulations at poolside, and elsewhere wherever chaise lounges and recliners 
are available for use: "During windy conditions, the use of the chaise lounges and recliners must be 
discontinued and users should leave the area." 
Consider also including such notice in the written material(s) provided to guests in connection with 
the availability and use of the guest amenities at your facility. 
Cleaning and Care 
Preventative Maintenance 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to clean does not 
mean that it will not get dirty in an outdoor environment.  A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping 
your new furnishings looking new, longer. 
Regular periodic care of your outdoor furniture will help maintain its appearance and functionality better than 
occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider the specific conditions and usage to which your product is exposed, so 
appropriate maintenance can be planned. 
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. Regular cleaning of outdoor furniture will help 
to prevent its forming.  Do not place flowerpots or any items on the furniture that will leave stains.  Do not place hot 
items directly onto resin furniture to avoid discoloration. 
Covers 
Covers can be purchased at a great price for any size furniture or table including sectionals and fire pits.  Using a 
good quality, weather proof, breathable cover for your purchase whether you are out of town, while the leaves 
are dropping, through pollen season, or through seasonal rains will not only reduce the amount of cleaning you 
have to do to keep your furniture looking new, it will also reduce the use and exposure to cleaning agents.  
Please send us an e-mail if we can help you with selecting and purchasing covers at 
solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com.
