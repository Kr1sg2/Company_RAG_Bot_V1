Introduction 
Originating as Royal Patio Manufacturing, President and owner David Peace re-strapped furniture for 
hotels and condominiums on the west coast of Florida. In 1991, he was able to move the business from 
his backyard to a 12’ x 24’ storage unit located in Bradenton, FL, where his manufacturing equipment 
grew to include a diacro hand bender, a chop saw, a drill press, and a welder. At that time, David was 
still the company’s only employee. 
As the business and reputation progressed, David began manufacturing raw frames and component 
parts for other manufacturers and refinishers throughout Florida. Five years later, and a few factory 
moves across town, Peace purchased a small powder coating system and began selling powder coated 
frames. The company’s payroll increased to include about twenty employees and the business expanded 
to manufacturing complete strap furniture, earning the company a strong reputation for providing 
quality commercial grade furniture. 
In 1997, The Windward Design Group® was born as a sister company to Royal Patio. That first year, 
Windward® developed the first sling style dining chair and began selling them to retailers across Florida. 
The factory soon grew to include a sewing room, allowing the expansion of the furniture line to include 
cushion-style seating. 
By 2002, Windward® was manufacturing eighteen different collections of furniture, including deep 
seating, and dining, with cushion, sling or strap styles. In 2006, the line increased to include padded 
slings as well. A couple of years later, Windward® launched the Replacement Cushion Division.  In 2012 
the line grew to include two wicker and multiple marine grade polymer collections. 
Today, Windward Design Group® operates in Sarasota, FL, where they produce over thirty-five 
collections, a full line of replacement cushions and employ over one hundred and thirty people. David 
Peace is still the President and two of his five children work by his side as well as his son-in-law. 
Although many things have changed, the business culture has remained the same. We take pride in 
manufacturing quality, stylish products and offering them at competitive prices.
