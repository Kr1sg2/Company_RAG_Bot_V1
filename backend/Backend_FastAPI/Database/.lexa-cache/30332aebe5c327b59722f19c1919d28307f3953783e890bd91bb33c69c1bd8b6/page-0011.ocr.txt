*Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of these mills 
and the mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make the new covers for your 
cushions.  If you would like completely new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the 
covers are being remade. Dye lot variation results in color differences from bolt to bolt and may not match your 
fabric swatch or previous shipments.
