Cleaning - What to Use 
Frames 
Nothing is better than a periodic rinse, and if necessary, using car wash soap or dish soap and a 
sponge to remove soiling.  If your frames require a more thorough cleaning, one of the best 
products to use for soiling is SIMPLE GREEN®.  If you have mold and mildew stains, you can use a 
mixture of water and bleach or straight bleach on all Garden Classics® frames.  Please be careful 
to use appropriate protection and to protect clothing and other fabrics in the area. 
Marine Grade Polymer 
Clean everyday dirt and stains with a soft sponge and mixture of mild detergent and water. Be 
wary of nylon “scrubbies” or stiff nylon brushes as excess force can mar the finish.  Stains and 
marks have been successfully removed with the following branded products: GOOF OFF®, 
GOJO® NATURAL ORANGE Pumice Industrial Hand Cleaner and SIMPLE GREEN®. 
 
To clean a petroleum stain such as grease or oil, use a citrus cleaner, alcohol or mineral 
spirits.  In severe cases, spray petroleum-based stains with WD40®. Then use toluene or acetone 
and a white nylon scrub pad (colored pads release staining dyes when combined with acetone).  
Do not use MEK, turpentine or naphtha solvent. 
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet, it is best to stand the cushion 
on end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between 
the frame and the cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy 
solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse 
thoroughly with fresh water.  Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE 
SEAMS OF THE CASE. 
If and only if your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may 
use 1-part bleach mixed with 1-part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a 
small inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse 
the cushion thoroughly to remove all the bleach solution.
