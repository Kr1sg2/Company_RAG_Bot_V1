The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Skilled American craftsman make, sew and assemble each component. 
Hardware 
Attention to detail is reflected in each & every piece of furniture manufactured.  360 or better 
stainless hardware is used for added strength and durability along with nylon glides for floor 
protection and ease of movement.  Windward® lasts in every situation including marine 
exposure. 
Material 
Only the highest quality, commercial grade, domestically milled, extruded aluminum materials 
(i.e., aluminum, stainless steel and polyethylene) that are capable of withstanding tropical 
marine exposure are used to construct Windward® products.  These durable materials make the 
product easy to maintain and easy to own. 
Construction 
Windward does not settle for just a chemical prewash before powder coating.  Their quality 
process begins with every part being thoroughly sandblasted to ensure the best finish adhesion. 
All products are then assembled by skilled American craftsman with 360⁰ welds, nylon glides, 
and if hardware is used, it is stainless steel.
