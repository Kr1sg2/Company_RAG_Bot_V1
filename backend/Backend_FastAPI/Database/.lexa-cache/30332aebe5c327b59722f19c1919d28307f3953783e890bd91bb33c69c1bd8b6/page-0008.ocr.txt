TURTLE WAX® Ice or other Spray Wax 
Automotive wax has changed a lot from the paste that came in a jar.  You can now 
spray clear protective polymer onto a surface and easily wipe it off with very little 
effort.  This will keep the surface protected from UV fading and from surface 
contact with salt, chlorine and dirt which commonly exists in the air of a back-yard 
setting.  Make applying spray wax to your aluminum, fiberglass, resin, and 
synthetic wicker surfaces a regular part of your maintenance routine and you will 
not only have the best-looking outdoor space in your neighborhood, your 
purchase will outlast everyone else’s as well. 
Coastal Exposure 
Living the coastal lifestyle is a dream for many.  Living the dream and living near the saltwater 
can be a challenge for anything left outside.  The salt in the humid air takes a toll on everything 
from the exterior of your home and your car, to your outdoor furniture.  The best preventative 
maintenance you can do for your outdoor furniture while living near the coast is to rinse it 
regularly with a hose to remove the salt and apply corrosion block to all metal surfaces and 
painted metal surface quarterly.  Any nonmetal surface should be sprayed quarterly with 
TURTLE WAX Ice following the directions on the bottle.
