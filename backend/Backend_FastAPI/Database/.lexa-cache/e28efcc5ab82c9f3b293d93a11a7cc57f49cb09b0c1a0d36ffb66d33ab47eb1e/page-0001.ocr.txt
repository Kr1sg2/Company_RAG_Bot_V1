Monthly Focus 
What: Transfers 
Why:   Transfers are how product move between locations.  If we do not 
transfer product correctly inventory will not be accurate and we 
will fail the customer.   
When:  Transfer Schedule is done weekly by the Warehouse.  It is done to 
refill stock, fulfill a customer’s order, or when manually directed 
to do so by a user in FROG. 
Who: All store team members are accountable for understanding the transfer system.  With this 
fundamental knowledge every team member will be able to best help the customer and create 
solutions.

 When should go backs be ready? 
o All products transferring out of the store should be located and moved to the load 
outdoor the evening before the transfer day. 
 What happens when I print a transfer list? 
o If the transfer waiting list is printed 48 hours before your transfer day you will remove 
the warehouses ability to see the transfer and they will not be able to create the work 
to execute the transfer.  In short, the transfer will not come.  If you accidentally print 
the transfer before your transfer day please contact the warehouse office to ensure the 
transfer still takes place.   (emails Leader’s – Warehouse Office Group) 
o It is ok and you are expected to print the transfer list after the warehouse team sends 
the message with the upcoming transfer numbers.  This will give you a hard copy of 
what is coming and going from your location.
