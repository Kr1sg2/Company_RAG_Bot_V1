Damaged or Broken Goods 
Your showroom display is your best-selling tool.  Items will wear out, get banged up, knocked 
over, or may have some sort of defect that can prevent you from selling the item or create a 
customer opposition.  Everyone on the store team should be on the look out for any item that is 
damaged or broken.  Discuss it between the team and take the appropriate action immediately.  
A floor displayed well with merchandise that is all in excellent condition will make everyone at 
your store more money.
