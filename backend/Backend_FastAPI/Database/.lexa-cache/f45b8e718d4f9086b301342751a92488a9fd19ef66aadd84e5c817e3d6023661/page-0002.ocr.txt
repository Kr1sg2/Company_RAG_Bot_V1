Always where eye protection to prevent foreign liquid or material from entering the eye. 
 
Sling Fabrics 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm 
soapy solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and 
rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  Allow to air dry. 
 
For stubborn stains or to remove discoloration from mildew use a mixture of one part 
bleach to 6 parts water.  Spot test a small area in an inconspicuous location for color 
fastness.  Apply the mixture to the sling fabric and brush with a soft bristle brush.  Take care 
not to get any on your clothes as it will discolor them.  Rinse thoroughly with water and 
allow to air dry.  Repeat again if Necessary.   
 
DO NOT USE STEAM OR WATER EXCEDING 100Â° F TO CLEAN YOUR SLING FABRIC.  DO NOT 
USE SOLVENTS, CARBON TETRACHLORIDE, SCOURING AGENTS, JANITORIAL CLEANSERS, 
GASOLINE, METAL BRUSHES OR HARD PLASTIC BRUSHES TO CLEAN YOUR SLING FABRIC.  
YOU MAY DAMAGE THE THREADS. 
 
 
Vinyl Strap 
Clean with a mixture of mild soap and warm water.  Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.  
Spray Armour-All on the vinyl strap after they are clean and dry to protect them.  All vinyl 
straps contain an effective fungicide and UV stabilizers.  If not maintained and cleaned 
periodically, mold and mildew will begin to grow on the accumulated dirt and grime and 
eventually migrate to the vinyl strap.  Once the vinyl strap is stained with mold or mildew it 
is very hard to clean and in some cases impossible to remove the discoloration.  A vinyl 
strap chair can have new straps put on to give it a fresh new look.   
 
DO NOT USE SOLVENTS, CARBON TETRACHLORIDE, SCOURING AGENTS, JANITORIAL 
CLEANSERS, GASOLINE, METAL BRUSHES OR HARD PLASTIC BRUSHES TO CLEAN YOUR 
STRAPS
