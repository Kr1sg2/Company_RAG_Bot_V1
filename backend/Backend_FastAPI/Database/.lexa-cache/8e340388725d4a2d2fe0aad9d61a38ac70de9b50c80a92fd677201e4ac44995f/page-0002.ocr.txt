Splitting an Order into More Than One Fulfilment 
Splitting a sales order into more than one fulfilment will cause the customer to receive a payment 
statement for each fulfilment.  Wells Fargo only invoices for the amount delivered.   
For each fulfilment the Balance Due field on the invoice must meet the following minimum value, or it 
should be paid in full before scheduling.

On the 12-month plan, the minimum monthly payment is 3.5% of the order total or $40, whichever is 
greater.  The amount financed must be paid off within the promotional term. Making minimum monthly 
payments may result in finance charges after the interest free promotional period.
