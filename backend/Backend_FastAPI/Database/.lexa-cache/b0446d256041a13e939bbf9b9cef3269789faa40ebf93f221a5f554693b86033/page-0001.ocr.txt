Styling & Design
•
All tubular frame construction provides a smooth and visually appealing look with improved 
safety (eliminating pinch points) and comfort in the seated position
•
Double locking TV headrest provides added comfort while lounging or watching TV by raising 
the upper body
•
To reduce field failures, the headrest also restricts the unit from being cycled while in the “up” 
position
•
Contoured seat section offers a wider seating area by allowing seating close to the arm
•
Forest Black color
Performance & Engineering
•
Body support tubes and wires together enhance support in the body section to eliminate sagging.
Body tubes keep the unit square and enhance unit strength
•
Polypropylene decking is designed to extend beyond the metal frame and linkage parts eliminating
any metal to upholstery contact
•
Optional seat support wires provide support while sleeping, plus adding durability to the over 
all unit.  Support wires also give the quality feel of stationary seating
