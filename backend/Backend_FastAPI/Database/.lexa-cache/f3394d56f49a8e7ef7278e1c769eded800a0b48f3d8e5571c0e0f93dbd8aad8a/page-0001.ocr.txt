AKZ OPEN CORD REPLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS – Sewing

If the cord has broken in the canopy structure, pull the cord beneath the main 
frame grip to guide the new cord through. 
If the cord has broken between the loop lock stopper and main frame grip, pull 
the cord at the canopy structure to guide the new cord through (as pictured 
above). 
 
In either circumstance, make absolutely certain the broken cord is pulled out 
of the frame so the new cord is threaded through. 
Locate where the cord has broken.

Using the needle and thread, sew 
the new cord to the broken cord that 
is still attached to the frame.   
Make certain the threading is strong 
and connects both cords tightly 
together.  
 Make sure there are minimal bulges 
in the connection; the two cords 
should look like they are one. 
Prepare a needle and thread.  Tie a 
knot at the end of the thread. 
When the cord’s connection is visible 
beneath the main frame grip, cut the 
threads connecting the new cord 
from the old cord.
