Cushion Care  
Drying 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the cushion on 
end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the 
frame and the cushion. 
Spot Clean 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with 
Meguiar's Extreme Multi-Surface Cleaner.  Spray the affected areas and rinse 
thoroughly.  For tough soiling brush area with a soft bristle brush in a circular motion, 
then rinse.  .  
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE 
THE SEAMS. 
Cushions made from 100% solution dyed acrylic can be cleaned with Bleach.  Use a 
premixed bleach cleaner or 50% bleach water mixture.  You can add mild dish soap 
to loosen soiling if desired.  Check a small inconspicuous spot for color fastness 
before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse the cushion thoroughly to 
remove all of the bleach solution. 
Fluff and Rotate 
The more a cushion is used the softer it will feel.  Pillow fill can settle and compress.  Rotate seat 
cushions every cleaning.  Fluff and loft pillow and backs to restore the look and make a comfortable 
sit.  Not rotating seat cushions over time may make your favorite seat feel noticeably softer than a 
seat not used as often.  Not fluffing pillows and backs occasionally will cause them to look flat and 
like they are missing fill.
