The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Skilled American craftsman make, sew and assemble each component. 
Hardware 
Attention to detail is reflected in each & every piece of furniture manufactured.  
360 or better stainless hardware is used for added strength and durability along 
with nylon glides for floor protection and ease of movement.  Windward® lasts in 
every situation including marine exposure. 
Material 
Only the highest quality, commercial grade, domestically milled, extruded aluminum materials 
(i.e., aluminum, stainless steel and polyethylene) that are capable of withstanding tropical 
marine exposure are used to construct Windward® products.  These durable materials make the 
product easy to maintain and easy to own. 
Construction 
Windward does not settle for just a chemical prewash before powder coating.  Their quality 
process begins with every part being thoroughly sandblasted to ensure the best finish adhesion. 
All products are then assembled by skilled American craftsman with 360⁰ welds, nylon glides, 
and if hardware is used, it is stainless steel. 
Safety  
In our continuing effort to ensure that your experience with your new purchase is positive with regard to comfort, 
quality and design, we take safety very seriously.  Please note the following important safety information, in 
addition to any other safety information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of damaged furniture can result in injury.  
Minor repair issues, if unaddressed, can become major repair and service issues that can create potential safety 
issues.  Contact the Leader Furniture® Solutions Center for support at solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com  
Product Inspection 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Inspections must include, 
but not be limited to, joint tightness, spring assemblies, and the weld areas of the product’s, arms and legs.  If 
joints are loose or any cracks should appear on the product or at welds, the item must immediately be removed 
from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing hardware 
be detected, the item must be removed from service immediately until the hardware 
can be properly tightened and/or replaced.  
Inspections must include chaise lounge and recliner headrest ratchets.  Periodically 
tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise lounges and recliners.  Confirm all other 
hardware is tight, movement is smooth without binding, and that the ratchet engages 
properly at each position.  At the same time, carefully inspect the headrest ratchets for 
breakage and/or wear. If headrest ratchet breakage and/or indications of headrest 
ratchet wear are present, a replacement headrest should be ordered.  The furniture 
must immediately be removed from service until repaired and/or replacement parts installed. 
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS AND ACCESSORIES section of this 
brochure.
