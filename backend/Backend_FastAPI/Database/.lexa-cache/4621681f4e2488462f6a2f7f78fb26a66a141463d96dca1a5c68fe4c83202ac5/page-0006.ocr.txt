In our continuing effort to ensure that your experience with Tropitone® 
furniture is positive with regard to comfort, quality and design, and also with 
regard to safety, please note the following important safety information, in 
addition to other safety information noted in this booklet. 
safety warning! Use of furniture needing care and maintenance or use of 
damaged furniture can result in injury. Also, minor repair issues can become 
major repair and service issues, and create potential safety issues. Contact 
your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative 
for support. 
product inspection
Periodically and carefully inspect all Tropitone® products for breakage and/
or indications of wear. Inspections must include, but not be limited to, spring 
assemblies and the weld areas of product seats, arms and legs. If any cracks 
should appear on the product or at welds, the item must immediately be 
removed from service until repaired. 
Inspections must include all bolts (on seating pieces, tables, umbrellas, 
etc.). Should any loose or missing hardware be detected, the item must 
be removed from service immediately until the hardware can be properly 
tightened and/or replaced. 
Inspections must include straps, slings and EZ Span™ segments. Should any 
loose, missing or damaged straps, slings or EZ Span™ segments be detected, 
the item must be removed from service immediately until repaired and/or 
replacement parts installed.
Inspections must include chaise lounge and recliner headrest ratchets. 
Periodically tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise lounges and recliners. 
Confirm all other hardware is tight, movement is smooth without binding, 
and that the ratchet engages properly at each position. At the same time, 
carefully inspect the headrest ratchets for breakage and/or wear. If headrest 
ratchet breakage and/or indications of headrest ratchet wear are present, a 
replacement headrest should be ordered. The furniture must immediately be 
removed from service until repaired and/or replacement parts installed. 
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS 
AND ACCESSORIES section of this brochure. 
Product failure caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and 
maintenance is not covered by the product warranty.
