tables
leveling
Select tables have leveling glides on the legs to accommodate uneven floors. 
If an adjustment is required, turn the glides to level the table. If necessary, 
pliers may carefully be used to aid in turning. 
replacing acrylic, glass, hpl or patterned aluminum 
table tops
Acrylic, glass, HPL or patterned aluminum table tops feature "Easy-On/Easy-
Off" clips to remove the table top. 
	 1.	 Prepare a smooth, non-scratch surface (a tarp or pool towels can be 	
	
	 	
placed on your work surface).
	 2.	 Remove the top and outer rim by pulling up on the rim with one hand 	 	
	 	
while a second person is holding down on the nearest leg. 
	 3.	 Separate the top from the rim by removing the plastic clips. Large 	
	
	 	
tables have tabs in the rim screwed to the table top ring – remove 
	 	
these screws.
	 4.	 Place the table rim upside down (flat edge down) on the protected surface. 
	 5.	 Peel off any protective packing material from the new table top surface 		
	 	
and put the new table top into the rim. 
	 6.	 Snap the supplied plastic clips into place starting where the top meets 		
	 	
the rim, then pressing under the "lip" around the edge of the rim. Use 
	 	
three (3) clips on small tables, four (4) clips on 42", 48" and 54" 
	 	
diameter tables, and six to eight (6 – 8) clips on larger tables. 
	 	
Position clips evenly around the rim. 
	 7.	 With the top and rim still upside down, insert the table base (with the 
	 	
legs pointing up) and press down, snapping it into place. On large 
	 	
tables, reinstall the screws that connect the tabs to the table top ring.
 
	 8.	 With a second person, turn the table upright and position for use. 
note: The textured side of the top should face down when the table is upright 
for textured glass and acrylic.
umbrella hole grommets
Any table top with an umbrella hole should have a grommet; acrylic tops must 
use a vinyl grommet around the circumference of the hole to protect it from 
breakage. *Exception: Ion Table Top. Umbrella hole grommets are available from 
your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative.
