	 6.	 Slowly slide both sides of the sling into the sling rail channel using

replacing chaise lounge headrest
hint: Place the headrest sling in the sun to warm the fabric which will allow 
the material to stretch during installation. 
	 1.	 With the headrest in a down position, use a utility knife to cut the entire 	
	 	
length of the headrest sling.
	 2.	 Remove the nylon end caps from the top of each sling rail channel with 		
	 	
a flat blade screwdriver and a mallet. Retain the end caps.
	 3.	 With the headrest in a down position, use pliers to pull the sling out 	
	
	 	
from the sling rails.
	 4.	 Remove one socket head cap screw (bolt) in the support bar. Loosen 
	 	
the other bolt in the support bar (some are welded on one side â€“ detach
	 	
other side only). Gently angle the detached side of the support bar 
	 	
below the sling rail; you may need to use a large screwdriver to pry 
	 	
the bar out of its position. This will allow the sling rails to be slightly 
	 	
angled together. 
	 5.	 Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or biodegradable 
	 	
liquid soap at the sling insertion point of each sling rail to ease 
	 	
installation.
