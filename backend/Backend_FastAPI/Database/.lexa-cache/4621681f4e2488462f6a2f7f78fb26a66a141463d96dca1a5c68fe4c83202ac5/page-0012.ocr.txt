fabric
The life of your furniture fabric largely depends on its care. Clean all spills 
promptly. Fabric life can be extended by simply rinsing down the furniture 
regularly with water. Certain suntan and sun block products may permanently 
discolor any fabric. This possibility can be minimized by immediately cleaning 
after contact. In addition, storing the cushions when not in use will extend 
cushion life. 
Prepare a cleaning solution with 1/4 cup (2 oz.) mild biodegradable liquid 
soap in a gallon of lukewarm water (no warmer than 100º F / 38º C). 
Clean fabric with the solution using a sponge or soft bristle brush. 
Rinse thoroughly with clean water. Allow to air dry. 
hint: Standing a cushion on its side will help it drain faster. 
caution: Certain suntan and sun block products contain "PABA". PABA 
is harmful to fabric and can permanently discolor it; therefore, contact 
with cushions or slings should be avoided. If contact is made, cleaning the 
fabric immediately with a non-abrasive, mild biodegradable soap and water 
solution followed by a fresh water rinse may minimize the possibility of 
discoloration. Laying a beach towel over the cushions or slings of outdoor 
furniture whenever you are using the furniture will prolong the fabric life.

Mildew may form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. 
Regular cleaning of the furniture will help to prevent its forming. If mildew 
does develop, add 1 cup bleach to the cleaning solution. Apply to the 
affected area and allow to soak in. Scrub with a soft bristle brush, then rinse 
thoroughly. Repeat if necessary. For stubborn mildew stains, use a household 
mildew remover – test in an inconspicuous location first. FOLLOW THE 
MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS.
