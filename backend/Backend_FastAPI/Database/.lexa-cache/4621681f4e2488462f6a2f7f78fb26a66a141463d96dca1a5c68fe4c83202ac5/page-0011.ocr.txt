cleaning and care
Regular periodic care of your Tropitone® furniture will maintain its 
appearance and functionality better than occasional, heavy duty 
maintenance. Consider the specific conditions and usage to which your 
product is exposed so appropriate maintenance is provided. Product failure 
caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and maintenance is not 
covered by the product warranty.
frames
Regularly tighten all hardware to avoid loosening which can lead to bolt 
failure and product breakage. Replace missing hardware (remove product 
from service until repaired). Regularly tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise 
lounges and recliners. Confirm movement is smooth without binding and that 
the ratchet engages properly at each position.
painted finishes
Painted finishes are used on aluminum seating, tables and umbrellas. 
Periodically clean the finish with a sponge or soft bristle brush using a 
cleaning solution with 1/4 cup (2 oz.) mild biodegradable liquid soap in a 
gallon of lukewarm water (100º F / 38º C). Rinse thoroughly. Avoid using 
abrasive cleaners. For gloss finishes, we recommend periodic waxing of the 
frame with a high grade automotive liquid wax or the use of a commercially 
available protectant to help maintain and/or restore the luster of the finish. 
Protectants can be purchased at most casual furniture retailers. 
caution seaside/indoor pool areas: In seaside use, salt can accumulate 
on the finish, leading to finish failure. In indoor pool areas, chlorides 
can accumulate on the finish, leading to finish failure. In both of these 
environments, repeated cycles of condensation followed by evaporation 
cause build-up of these aggressive corrosives. Regular cleaning with mild 
biodegradable liquid soap and water will remove the concentrated deposits 
and protect the furniture finish per the above instructions.
