	 6.	 Hold the can 4 – 6 inches away from the surface to be painted. Apply 	
	
	 	
the touch-up paint with short light sprays until complete coverage is

touching up textured finishes
Do NOT try to get full coverage with the first coat.
	 6.	 Hold spray can 4 – 6 inches away from surface to be painted. 
	 	
Spray a thin coat and let dry. 
	 7.	 Spray a second coat and let dry. Repeat until desired coverage 
	 	
is achieved. 
caution: One heavy coat may cause the surrounding finish to loosen and 
wrinkle due to the solvents in the spray paint.
caution: Trying to get full coverage in the first coat may result in a glossy 
surface. Should this happen, dull with a light (thin) coat applied after the 
offending glossy coat has dried. 
	 8.	 Certain colors require a second coat with a supplied "Step 2" spray 	
	
	 	
paint. Hold the can 12 inches from the surface and use one quick pass. 	 	
	 	
Allow to dry.
	 9.	 Certain colors require a third coat with a supplied "Step 3" spray paint. 	
	 	
Hold the can 12 inches from the surface and use one quick pass. 
	 	
Allow to dry.
paint storage hint: Always flush the paint out of the nozzle after use by 
turning the can upside down and depressing the nozzle, spraying onto a 
disposable cloth. Store touch-up spray cans upside down as the nozzles are 
less likely to clog.
