replacing chaise lounge seat
	 1.	 Remove the nylon end caps from the foot of each sling rail channel with
	 	
a flat blade screwdriver and a mallet. Retain the end caps. Some 
	 	
chaises don’t have end caps at the foot – tilt the headrest fully forward 
	 	
and remove the end caps from the other end of the sling rails.
	 2.	 On one sling rail, use a 3/16" Allen wrench to remove the two socket 
	 	
head cap screws (bolts) towards the foot of the sling rail so it can be 
	 	
slightly angled towards the attached sling rail. On the other sling rail, 
	 	
loosen two bolts from the foot end of the sling rail until only a few 
	 	
threads remain engaged. Some chaises have one welded sling rail – 
	 	
remove the bolted rail only.
	 3.	 Use pliers to slide the sling out from the sling rails. You will need to 	
	
	 	
alternate pulling between each side several inches at a time.
	 4.	 Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or biodegradable 	

	 	
liquid soap at the sling insertion point of each sling rail to ease 	
	
	 	
installation.
	 5.	 Position the new seat sling so the production tag and/or law labels 	

	 	
will be at the foot of the chaise and the finished side of the sling is 
	 	
facing forward. Slide the vinyl splines (plastic rods) within the fabric to
	 	
be even with the end of the fabric where it will touch the two remaining
	 	
end caps.
