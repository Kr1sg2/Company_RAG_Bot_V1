The contemporary design is enhanced with a wide selection of fabrics and 
complemented by comfortable cushion design. Should the cushions become 
wet, remove cushions from the base and stand on end to allow to drain and 
dry. Wipe down the base deck surface to remove any residual water.
Remove cushions, bolsters, and throw pillows to prevent staining of fabric, 
as cleaners used on polymer resin furniture are not appropriate for fabric. 
Unsnap back and seat cushions by gently pulling the snap at the connection 
to the cushion. Stack on a clean and dry surface.
Apply cleaning solution (Simple Green®, Mr. Clean®, or other non-abrasive 
multi-purpose cleaner) directly to heavily soiled areas. Using a mild scrub 
sponge, wipe the entire furniture surface. Heavily soiled areas can be 
scrubbed with the scouring pad or scrubbing sponge. 
Rinse furniture thoroughly with clean water. Dry completely before installing 
cushions. Install seat cushions and snap into place. Install back cushions and 
snap into place. Replace bolsters and throw pillows.

When using outdoors, basic safety precautions should always be followed to 
reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, and personal injury.
Ground Fault Circuit Interruption (GFCI) protection is required on the circuit 
or outlet to be used for any wet location, including all outdoor locations.  
Receptacles are available which have built in GFCI protection and are 
acceptable to be used for this measure of safety.
Refer to the Tropitone Installation Instructions that were shipped with your 
product for further information.
