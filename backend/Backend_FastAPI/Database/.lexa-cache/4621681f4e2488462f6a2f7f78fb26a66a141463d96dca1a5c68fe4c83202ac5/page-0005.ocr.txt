Please refer to this booklet for information regarding the care, maintenance 
and warranty for your Tropitone®, Basta Sole®, and Tropitone® Valora™ 
product lines. The information provided in the various sections will pertain 
to all Tropitone® product lines.
Please save your receipt so you have a record of Tropitone® model numbers 
purchased, as you may wish to add accessories, update your fabric, or 
expand your collection during your ownership of Tropitone® furniture. Your 
sales receipt will be required to review any warranty claim.
Regular periodic care of your Tropitone® furniture will maintain its 
appearance and functionality better than occasional, heavy duty 
maintenance. Consider the specific conditions and usage to which your 
product is exposed so appropriate maintenance is provided. 
Mildew can form on dirt or other substances deposited upon the fabric. 
Regular cleaning of outdoor furniture will help to prevent its forming.
 
Please read this booklet carefully and in its entirety. Contact your Tropitone® 
Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative if you have additional 
questions.
