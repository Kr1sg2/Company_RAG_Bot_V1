straps, lacing and ez span™ segments
Vinyl straps, lacing and EZ Span™ segments must be cleaned frequently with 
a sponge or soft bristle brush using a cleaning solution with 1/4 cup (2 oz.) 
mild biodegradable liquid soap in a gallon of lukewarm water (100º F / 38º C). 
Rinse thoroughly. 
In geographical areas with high concentrations of acid rain, fog and/or smog, 
vinyl must be cleaned monthly with a lukewarm water and ammonia mixture. 
Use three parts water to one part ammonia. Rinse thoroughly.
For furniture with woven straps or lacing, be sure to lift and clean beneath 
the strap and/or lace intersections. Commercial casual furniture cleaners will 
help lift embedded dirt and oil from vinyl and are available at leading casual 
furniture dealers. EZ Span™ segments have a slight texture; the segments 
may be cleaned lightly with a non-scratch scrub sponge or soft bristle brush 
to lift embedded dirt. caution: Do NOT use abrasive cleaners on vinyl straps, 
lacing or EZ Span™ segments.
caution: Certain suntan and sun block products contain "PABA". PABA is 
harmful to vinyl and can permanently discolor it; therefore, contact with vinyl 
straps or lacing should be avoided. If contact is made, cleaning the vinyl 
immediately with a non-abrasive, mild biodegradable soap and water solution 
followed by a fresh water rinse may minimize the possibility of discoloration. 
Laying a beach towel over the vinyl straps of outdoor furniture whenever you 
are using the furniture will help protect the vinyl from the discoloring effects 
of PABA.
