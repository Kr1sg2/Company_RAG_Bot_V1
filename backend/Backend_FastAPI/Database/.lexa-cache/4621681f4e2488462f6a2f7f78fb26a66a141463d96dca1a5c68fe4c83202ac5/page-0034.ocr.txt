	 1.	 Heat the vinyl straps in hot water for several minutes. Use tongs to 
	 	
remove straps from hot water. 
	 	
safety warning! Be sure to protect your hands with gloves when 	
	
	 	
handling hot straps. 
	 2.	 Remove old straps – cut down the middle of the straps to be replaced. 
	 	
Unwrap and disconnect. Notice how the wrap "rotation" of the strap 
	 	
comes off from the frame. You will wrap the new straps the same way. 
	 	
Clean the frame.
	 3.	 Attach one end of the strap to the frame (for rivet straps, install one 	
	
	 	
rivet) as shown below. Wrap the strap around the frame, slowly and 	
	
	 	
steadily stretching (so narrow spots don’t develop) the strap to the 	
	
	 	
opposite side. 
	 4.	 Two inches off to one side of the rivet hole or slot, wrap the remaining 	 	
	 	
end of the strap around the frame one time. Continue wrapping toward 	
	 	
the slot or rivet hole until fully wrapped. Fasten this end to the frame 	
	
	 	
with the second rivet or by putting the tab in the slot. 
	 5.	 Realign the strap by shifting it back over the tab or rivet which will 
	 	
"double wrap" the connection point. The strap will tighten when cooled.
	 6.	 Repeat for remaining straps.
