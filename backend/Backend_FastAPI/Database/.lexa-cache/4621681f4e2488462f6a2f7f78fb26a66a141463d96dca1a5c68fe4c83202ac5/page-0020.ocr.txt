fire pits
All Tropitone® Fire Pits are designed and intended for outdoor use only. 
Never install or operate indoors. Burning gas (both Natural and LP) 
produces fumes which can be dangerous if inhaled. Always insure there is 
proper ventilation when using any fire products.
Never leave this product on when unattended. Educate all persons, 
including children that may come in contact with this unit of the danger 
of high temperatures produced when operating, including surface 
temperatures. Clothing and other flammable materials should not be hung 
from the appliance, or placed on or near the appliance. Young children 
should be carefully supervised when they are in the area of the appliance.
Tropitone® recommends that all gas products be installed by professionals 
that are licensed by the local authority having jurisdiction in gas piping.
Tropitone® recommends that all gas products installed in the USA and 
Canada be serviced and maintained by professionals that are certified 
by the National Fireplace Institute (NFI) as NFI Specialist or by the Wood 
Energy Technical Training (WETT).
