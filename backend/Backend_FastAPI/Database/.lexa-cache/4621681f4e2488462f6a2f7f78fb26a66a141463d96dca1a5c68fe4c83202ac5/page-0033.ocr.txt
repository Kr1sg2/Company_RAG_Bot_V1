replacing straps and lacing
Most Tropitone® furniture can be re-strapped at home or on site, by your 
local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative, or at 
a recommended repair center. Simply order the color and number of pre-cut 
straps needed from your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales 
Representative. Tropitone® has two methods of attaching a strap: the "rivet 
style" uses a nylon rivet inserted through a hole in the strap and pressed into a 
corresponding hole in the frame, the "slot style" utilizes a tab configuration on 
the strap end which fits into a slot punched in the frame. When ordering straps, 
provide the chair name and number, vinyl color, and the strap type: rivet style 
or slot style. New nylon rivets will be included with a "rivet style" strap order.
