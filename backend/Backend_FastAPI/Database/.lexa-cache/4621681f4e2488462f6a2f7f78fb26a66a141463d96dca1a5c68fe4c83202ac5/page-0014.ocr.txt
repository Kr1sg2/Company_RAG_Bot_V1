cleaning and care
Dry thoroughly to prevent streaks, rubbing with the grain. Thorough 
rinsing and drying will remove detergent and allow the metal to "breathe", 
preventing corrosion.
Install seat cushions and snap into place. Install back cushions and snap 
into place. Notice corner module back cushions have a left and right back 
cushion. Replace accessory pillows.
caution: Do NOT use the following products on stainless steel – damage 
may occur:
	 X	 Bleach or cleaners containing bleach (can corrode stainless steel)
	 X	 Hydrochloric acid or cleaners with chloride (can corrode stainless steel)
	 X	 Abrasive pads or cleaners (will scratch or polish finish)
	 X	 Rubbing motion against metal grain (can change finish)
stain or rust removal
Should a stain or rust occur on the stainless steel, promptly clean the 
deposit. Lingering stains can become permanent. Rust can permanently etch 
or pit the stainless steel.
Apply a non-abrasive stainless steel cleaner/polish. FOLLOW THE 
MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS. Test in an inconspicuous spot to insure 
original finish isn’t altered. Remember to rub with the metal grain (not in 
a circular motion). Rinse furniture thoroughly with clean water. Finally, dry 
thoroughly to prevent streaks, rubbing with the grain.
If the stain or rust remains, you can use a Scotch-Brite® No Scratch Multi-
Purpose Scrub Sponge or a Scotch-Brite® General Purpose Hand Pad 7447 
to polish the stainless steel. It is critical to rub with the metal grain (not in 
a circular motion). Rinse furniture thoroughly with clean water. Finally, dry 
thoroughly to prevent streaks, rubbing with the grain.
caution: Salt or acid (from coffee, wine, orange juice, tomato juice, lemon, 
etc) can discolor stainless steel if not cleaned up promptly.
caution seaside/indoor pool areas: Stainless steel products used in 
seaside or indoor pool settings will require more frequent cleaning to remove 
chloride deposits to prevent corrosion and etching.
