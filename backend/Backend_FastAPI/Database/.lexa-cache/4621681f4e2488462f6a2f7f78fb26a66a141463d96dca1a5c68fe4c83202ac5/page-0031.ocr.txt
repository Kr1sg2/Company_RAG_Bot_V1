replacing chaise lounge headrest (continued)
	 6.	 Position the new headrest sling so the finished side of the sling is 
	 	
facing forward. For padded headrest slings, check for an additional 
	 	
finishing sew line at one end of the sling – orient this end of the sling to
	 	
the top of the chaise. Slide the vinyl splines (plastic rods) within 
	 	
the fabric to be even with the end of the fabric where it will touch the 
	 	
two remaining end caps.
	 7.	 Slowly slide both sides of the sling into the sling rail channel using 	
	
	 	
pliers until the sling reaches both end caps. You will need to alternate 
	 	
pulling on each side.
	 8.	 A sling tool can be helpful at this step (available for purchase from your
	 	
local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative). 
	 	
Using two persons, reposition the headrest support bar which will pull 
	 	
the sling tight. Pry between slide rail and the support bar while the 
	 	
second person moves the support bar inside the sling rails. Align the 
	 	
hole in the support bar with the hole in the sling rail – an alignment tool 
	 	
or small Phillips screwdriver may be needed. Reinstall the bolt and 	
	
	 	
washer then fully tighten both support bar bolts.
	 9.	 Trim excess vinyl spline from both sling rails. 
	 10.	Reinsert the end caps. Tap gently with the mallet until fully inserted.
