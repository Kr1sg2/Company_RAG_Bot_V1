the tropitone ® difference
fabric and fills
All of our fabrics for slings, cushions and umbrellas are designed and 
constructed for outdoor use and are formulated to withstand the elements. 
All dry quickly, contain mildew inhibitors and are stain resistant. Please note 
that proper care will extend the life of the fabric.
All of our cushions are water-resistant and feature quality polyester fill and/
or foam. This fill and foam are designed to dry quickly and retain its loft 
during use. Our outdoor cushions are constructed of fabrics containing UV 
and mildew inhibitors. Additionally, each cushion is constructed of a mildew-
resistant core of self-draining fills, which is then wrapped in a water resistant 
covering. Very little water will enter into the cushion, but will quickly drain by 
standing the cushion on its side. 
Tropitone® "tight seat" cushions were created to be weather resistant, using 
outdoor grade materials and utilizing a moisture barrier beneath the fabric 
covering. All removable pads and lounge cushions will quickly drain water by 
standing the cushion on its side. 
All Tropitone® fabrics, fill and foam are flame retardant, meeting fire code 
rating CA117.
table tops

Clear Glass, Textured Glass, Stoneworks® Collections, HPL, Cast Aluminum, 
Patterned Aluminum, and Natural Stone products. Many of these are 
available with holes to accommodate the use of an umbrella. 
acrylic table tops are highly impact resistant. The textured surface helps 
hide any scuffs or scratches.

into cubes, not shatter into sharp shards.

durable construction. They feature a thick soft radius edge with a textured 
stone pattern.
