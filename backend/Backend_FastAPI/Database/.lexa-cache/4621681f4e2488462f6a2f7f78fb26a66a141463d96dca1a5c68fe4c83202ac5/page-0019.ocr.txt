cleaning and care
teak wood
Periodically clean teak with a sponge or soft bristle brush using a cleaning 
solution with 1/4 cup (2 oz.) mild biodegradable liquid soap in a gallon of 
lukewarm water (100º F / 38º C). Rinse thoroughly.
Teak will naturally weather to a soft grey patina color over time when exposed 
to the elements. This process could take up to several years depending on 
your climate. If you desire this natural finish, do nothing to the teak furniture 
other than periodic cleaning described above. 
Mildew may form on teak; regular cleaning of outdoor furniture will help 
to prevent its forming. If mildew does develop, add 1/4 cup bleach to the 
cleaning solution. Apply to the affected area and scrub with a soft bristle 
brush, then rinse thoroughly. Repeat if necessary. 
Should you choose to retain the original look of teak, apply a high grade teak 
wood sealer before the product weathers. FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER’S 
INSTRUCTIONS. Be aware sealing will become a periodic maintenance 
task. Some teak sealer manufacturers recommend applying teak oil prior to 
sealing, which can intensify the color and grain of the wood. If the teak has 
already weathered and you wish to restore the original finish, apply teak 
wood cleaner that is designed to restore weathered teak. Tropitone® does 
not warranty the furniture finish when sealed or oiled. Always FOLLOW THE 
MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS for application of oil, cleaner and sealer.
caution: Do NOT get teak oil, teak sealer or teak cleaner on the fabric.
