routine care:

To clean granite and marble, apply the natural stone cleaner to the stone 
surface. FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS. Wipe off with a 
soft, absorbent cloth. For heavily soiled areas, allow cleaner to stand for 
about one minute before wiping off.
caution: Alcohol or acid (from coffee, wine, orange juice, tomato juice, 
lemon, etc.) can etch stone sealer and natural stone if not cleaned up 
promptly. This will promote staining.
caution: The following should NOT be used to clean natural stone – damage 
may occur:
	 X	 Bleach or cleaners with bleach
	 X	 Glass cleaners
	 X	 Vinegar
	 X	 Ammonia
	 X	 Cleaners containing lemon or orange
	 X	 Abrasive powders or liquids
	 X	 Scouring pad or scrubbing sponge 
 
note: If a detergent is used on stone surface, a soap film will develop. Clean 
with a stone cleaner to remove the soap film.
If liquids darken or discolor the stone surface, sealer re-coating is necessary 
immediately. See the Natural Stone Sealing section.
