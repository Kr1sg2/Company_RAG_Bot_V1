Representative, you will need to know the model numbers for the pieces you 
want to re-sling. Refer to your original sales receipt for this information.

hint: Observe washer or spacer placement as hardware is removed, so 
hardware can be reinstalled properly.
	 1.	 Use a utility knife to cut the entire length of the sling.
	 2.	 Remove the nylon end caps from the top and bottom of both sling 
	 	
rail channels with a flat blade screwdriver and a mallet. Retain the 
	 	
end caps.
	 3.	 Use a 3/16" Allen wrench to loosen the two socket head cap screws 
	 	
(bolts) on one sling rail until only a few threads are engaged. Some 
	 	
chairs have one welded sling rail – loosen the bolted rail only. 
	 4.	 Remove the spreader bar (some have a 90º bend on one end to "hook" 
	 	
into the sling rail) from the upper back of the chair. 
	
	
• two hole style: Disconnect one sling rail to remove the spreader bar, 	
	 	
then reinstall the sling rail by only putting bolts and washers/spacers 	 	
	 	
until only a few threads are engaged. 
	
	
• slot style: This style spreader bar has a slot on one side – lift up 	
	
	 	
through the slot and remove.
	 5.	 Use pliers to slide the sling out from the sling rails, pulling the sling 
	 	
down and out to the front of the chair.
