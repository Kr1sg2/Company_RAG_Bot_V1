the tropitone ® difference
You have made an investment in fine casual furniture. This booklet is 
intended to help you take care of your Tropitone® products and explains 
the special design and assembly techniques that make Tropitone® 
furniture worth maintaining – the special features that make 
The Tropitone® Difference. 
frames
All Tropitone® extruded aluminum furniture frames feature a welded, all 
aluminum frame construction. Tropitone® uses full circumference welding 
in all load bearing joints since it is the strongest way to join two pieces 
of aluminum. 
Tropitone® collections may feature frames that are either solid cast aluminum 
or a combination of cast and extruded aluminum. Cast to extruded material 
connections have a deep penetrating weld design to insure superior strength. 
finishes
pre-wash/pre-finish 
All Tropitone® casual furniture is prepared for our powder coated finish in 
a multi-step wash process which both cleans the frame and also applies 
a special finish-bonding agent. This ensures that the powder coating will 
adhere uniformly. 
powder coating 
Tropitone® durable polyurethane or polyurethane/polyester blend powder 
coating is significantly thicker than paint. It is applied electrostatically as 
a powder and then baked at temperatures exceeding 400° F / 205° C. This 
causes the powder to melt and flow evenly all around the frame. Because 
the powder coating process follows the frame construction, the entire frame 
is actually sealed in this powder coating. Tropitone® pioneered textured 
finishes for outdoor furniture. 
strapping, lacing and ez span™ segments
Tropitone® uses only the finest, heavy-gauge virgin vinyl with added 
mildew inhibitors and ultraviolet stabilizers. We require a specific vinyl 
thickness and hardness durometer for durability and "memory". (The 
"memory" of the vinyl is its ability to return to the original shape after use.) 
Our vinyl is formulated to provide years of service. The proprietary material 
that formulates our EZ Span™ segments also must meet these same 
material requirements.
