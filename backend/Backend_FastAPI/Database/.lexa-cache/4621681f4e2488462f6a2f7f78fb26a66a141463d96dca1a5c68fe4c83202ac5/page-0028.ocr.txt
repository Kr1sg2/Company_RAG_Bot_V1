	 6.	 Apply a small amount of water soluble cold cream or liquid biodegradable
	 	
soap at the sling insertion point (top) of each sling rail to ease installation.
	 7.	 For one piece slings, position the sling so the production tag and/or law 
	 	
label will be at the foot of the chair and the finished side of the sling is 	 
	 	
facing forward. Start at the top of the loosened sling rail and slowly slide 
	 	
the sling along the sling rail channel using pliers.
	 8.	 After sliding the first side of the sling onto the loosened sling rail, detach 	
	 	
this sling rail from the chair frame.
	 9.	 Have a second person hold the disconnected sling rail on which you 
	 	
have installed the sling. Use pliers to firmly and slowly slide the 
	 	
remaining side of the sling into the other sling rail. 
	 	
reminder: the bolts should already be loosened on this sling rail.
	 10.	Pull the sling down a couple inches on the disconnected rail. Insert the
	 	
spreader bar straight end (non-hook) in the attached sling rail hole. 
	
	
• two hole style: Have a second person help by firmly stretching the 
	 	
sling rails apart and then slightly rotating the detached rail. Insert the 
	 	
hook end of the spreader bar into the hole. This may take a few tries – 	 	
	 	
take your time with this step.
	
	
• slot style: After inserting the spreader bar into the attached sling rail 	
	 	
hole, lower the other end into the slot.
	 11.	 Pull the sling evenly up and down to the ends of both sling rails.
	 12.	A sling tool can be helpful at this step (available for purchase from your 
	 	
local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative). 
	 	
Have a second person position the detached sling rail to be attached, 
	 	
aligning the bolt holes. Reinstall the bolt and washer/spacer in the front 
	 	
seat area, only tightening a few turns. Reinstall the bolt and washer/
	 	
spacer in the back seat area. Fully tighten both bolts in this sling rail.
	 13.	On the other sling rail, tighten each bolt several turns using the Allen 
	 	
wrench, alternating between each bolt to apply even tension. Continue
	 	
until both bolts are fully tightened.
	 14.	Trim excess vinyl spline (plastic rod) from the top and bottom of both 	
	
	 	
sling rails using the cutting pliers. 
	 15.	Reinsert the end caps. Tap gently with the mallet until fully inserted.
