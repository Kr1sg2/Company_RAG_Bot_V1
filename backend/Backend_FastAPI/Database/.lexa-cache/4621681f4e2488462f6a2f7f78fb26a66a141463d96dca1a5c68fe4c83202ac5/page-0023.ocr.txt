preparing surfaces for touch up
Touch-up paint to match the frame color is available directly from your local 
Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative. 
	 1.	 Wash the scratched area to remove any dirt or grease. 
	 2.	 Rinse thoroughly with clean water. Dry.
	 3.	 Remove cushions. Protect fabric, frame, and all surface areas that are 	 	
	 	
not to be painted.
	 4.	 Sand the scratch lightly to "soften" the edge with fine grit sandpaper 	 	
	 	
so that the touch-up paint will blend in easily. Sand as small an area 
	 	
as possible so you don’t create additional work. 
	 5.	 Clean with rubbing alcohol.

	 6. 	 Spray touch-up paint onto a flat plate or dish. Use a small artist's 
	 	
brush to transfer the paint from the plate to the aluminum outdoor 
	 	
furniture. Texture can be enhanced with a clean, dry brush after 
	 	
the paint becomes tacky.

	 6.	 Hold spray can 4 – 6 inches away from surface to be painted. 
	 	
Spray a thin coat and let dry. 
	 7.	 Spray a second coat and let dry. Repeat until desired coverage 
	 	
is achieved. Do not let the paint fully dry. Wait 3 – 5 minutes for 
	 	
the paint to become tacky. Pat with a damp (not soaking) cloth to create 	
	 	
texture (a dry cloth will pick up too much paint). Make sure the damp 	 	
	 	
cloth is lint free.
