care and maintenance for fire products
Regular periodic care of your Tropitone® Fire Pit will maintain its appearance 
and functionality better than occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider 
the specific conditions and usage to which your product is exposed so 
appropriate maintenance is provided. Product failure caused by a lack of 
reasonable and necessary care and maintenance is not covered by the 
product warranty.
