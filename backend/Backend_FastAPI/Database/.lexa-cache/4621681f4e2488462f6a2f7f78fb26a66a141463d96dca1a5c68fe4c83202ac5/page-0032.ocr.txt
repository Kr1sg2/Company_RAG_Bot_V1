replacing cushions
Cushions can be replaced to update the appearance of your Tropitone® 
furniture and beautify your outdoor living areas. Tropitone® offers 
replacement cushions to match all current and many discontinued frame 
styles. You may select cushion fabric from our extensive fabric offering, or 
you may supply your own material. All our cushions feature quality polyester 
fill and/or foam. The fill is designed to dry quickly and retain its loft during 
use. Contact your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales 
Representative for cushion styles, fabric selection and pricing. To purchase, 
you will need to know the model numbers for the pieces on which you want 
to replace cushions. Refer to your original sales receipt for this information.
