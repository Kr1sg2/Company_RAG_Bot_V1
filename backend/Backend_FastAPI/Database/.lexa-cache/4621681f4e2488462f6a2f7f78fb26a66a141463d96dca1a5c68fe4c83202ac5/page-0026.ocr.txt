Now, lift the chair and firmly bring it down so that long leg contacts the wood. 
This should adjust the longer leg. If there is serious unevenness that cannot 
be corrected, contact your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract 
Sales Representative.
lubrication of swivels, wheels and hinges
Periodic lubrication with a silicon lubricant spray of all moving parts is 
recommended to extend the product life and minimize squeaks or noises. 
FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER’S INSTRUCTIONS for use. 
stacking and nesting
Tropitone® recommends that when moving or storing any stacking aluminum 
outdoor furniture it is stacked no more than the specific recommended stack 
heights for safety and to reduce the potential from rubbing, wear or marring 
of the frame finishes. Nesting furniture comes forward as it is stacked, 
therefore maximum nest height is especially critical as the stack could slide 
if the limit is exceeded. Contact your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or 
Contract Sales Representative for stack quantity. 
safety warning! Do NOT sit on any furniture that is already stacked.
tire replacement
Installing a new tire on chaise lounges or serving carts may be easier after 
soaking the tire in hot water for several minutes. Use tongs to remove it 
from the hot water and be sure to protect your hands with gloves when 
handling. Simply pull the old tire off and push the new tire on. Contact your 
local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative for a 
replacement part. 
winter storage 
Tropitone® furniture is intended to be used outdoors. In milder climates, the 
furniture can be left outdoors year-round. Each piece has drain holes built 
into the frame to minimize water build up. 
caution: Do NOT store frames upside down.
If you live in an area that experiences freezing conditions, store your clean 
and dry Tropitone® outdoor furniture right side up in a dry, protected place. 
Water can collect and/or condense inside the frame tubing – if exposed to 
freezing temperatures, this water could freeze causing the frame tubing to 
crack or burst. This damage is NOT covered under your warranty.
