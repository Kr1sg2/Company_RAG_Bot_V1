natural stone sealing
Sealing with quality stone care products will help to protect the granite from 
absorbing liquids and staining. In a residential setting, sealing on a semi-
annual (twice yearly) basis should be sufficient. In a contract environment, 
more frequent sealing will be needed. 
Sun exposure and other factors increase sealing frequency. If liquids darken 
or discolors the stone surface, sealer re-coating is necessary immediately. 
Test by allowing water to remain for ten (10) minutes and observing the 
stone surface. If the stone darkens or absorbs the liquid, immediate sealing
 is needed.
FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURER’S NATURAL STONE SEALER INSTRUCTIONS 
IS CRITICAL FOR GOOD RESULTS. Sealing with a penetrating (or impregnating) 
sealer will provide a protective coating to stand up to the daily use of stone 
cleaners and normal exposure to liquids, while minimizing opportunity for 
liquids and stains to penetrate the stone. Multiple coats of sealer may be 
needed on porous stone. Repeat penetrating sealer application until sealer 
isn’t absorbed by the stone.
Should your natural stone incur a stain, contact a local stone resource for 
products and guidance regarding stain removal. Stain removal is difficult – in 
some cases, only fading of the stain will be achieved. It is far better to prevent 
stains with proper cleaning and sealing.
