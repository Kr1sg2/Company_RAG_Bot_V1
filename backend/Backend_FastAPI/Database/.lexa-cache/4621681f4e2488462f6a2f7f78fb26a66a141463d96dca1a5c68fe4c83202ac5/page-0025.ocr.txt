frames
Regularly tighten all hardware to avoid loosening which can lead to bolt 
failure and product breakage. Replace missing hardware (remove product 
from service until repaired). Regularly tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise 
lounges and recliners. Confirm movement is smooth without binding and that 
the ratchet engages properly at each position.
glides and end caps
Glides (often referred to as "nylon feet") are sometimes lost or become worn 
with use, and should be replaced when lost or worn for stability and safety. 
Replacement glides and end caps are available from your local Tropitone® 
Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative. 
Certain nylon glides and end caps are available in various colors depending 
upon the frame color. When ordering replacement glides and end caps, 
please specify frame color. Replacement parts for older models may only be 
available in limited colors.
riveted nylon glides
Nylon glides that are riveted to the tubing can be replaced by drilling out the 
existing rivet and installing a new glide with a new pop rivet. A pop rivet tool 
or kit is available at most hardware stores. 
riveted cups with nylon caps
Your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or Contract Sales Representative can 
supply either the replacement glides or a complete kit with cup, screw and 
nylon cap. 
welded cups with nylon caps
If the aluminum cup is worn or broken off, it can be replaced by drilling a pilot 
hole and using a self-tapping screw to hold the aluminum cup in place. A 
nylon cap snaps easily over this aluminum cup. 
leveling
Many dining table legs and many other table legs have leveling glides 
which can be adjusted so the table will sit level. On other table and seating 
pieces, check that the glides (nylon feet) are properly seated and not worn. 
Replacement glides are available through your local Tropitone® Residential 
Dealer or Contract Sales Representative. 
If a chair or small table sits unevenly on the floor, determine if the floor is flat 
by switching it with another piece in a different area. If the wobble moves 
with the piece, determine the "long" leg. Begin adjustment by placing a 
small block of wood on the floor under the long leg.
