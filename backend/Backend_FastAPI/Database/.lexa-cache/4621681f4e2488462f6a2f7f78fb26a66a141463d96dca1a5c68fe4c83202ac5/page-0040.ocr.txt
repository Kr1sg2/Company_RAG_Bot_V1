replacement parts
Tropitone® offers accessories and replacement parts for current and various 
discontinued umbrella styles, such as hubs, arms, etc. You may select new 
fabric from our extensive fabric offering, or we can use your own material 
to recover your umbrella. See your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer or 
Contract Sales Representative for accessory and part availability, fabric 
selection and pricing. You will need to know the model numbers for your 
umbrella. Refer to your original sales receipt for this information.
storage
Always allow market umbrellas and patio umbrellas to dry completely before 
storing and fold carefully to avoid wrinkling the fabric. Protect with a cover 
and lay on a hard, flat surface in a well-ventilated location.
