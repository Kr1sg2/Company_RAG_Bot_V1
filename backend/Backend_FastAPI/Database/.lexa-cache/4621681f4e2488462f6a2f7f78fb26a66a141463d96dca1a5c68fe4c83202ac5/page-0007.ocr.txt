chaise lounge and recliners
chaise lounge headrest ratchet replacement
Tropitone® chaise lounges are equipped with metal headrest ratchets which 
are welded in place and normally do not need replacement. If an older chaise 
lounge is equipped with nylon headrest ratchets, discontinue use of such 
chaise lounges immediately. 
residential customers: Contact your local Tropitone® Residential Dealer 
for replacement. 
contract customers: Contact your Tropitone® Contract Sales Representative 
(except for ratchets that have been retrofitted with a Tropitone® "J" bracket 
retrofit kit).
headrest adjustment
safety warning! Chaise lounge and recliner headrests must NEVER be 
adjusted while seated in the chaise. Serious finger, hand or other bodily 
injury may result from adjusting the headrest while seated. Headrests must 
always be adjusted while out of the furniture and standing to the side. 
notice for contract installations: Include the following or substantially 
similar conspicuous written notice as part of the posted Rules and 
Regulations at poolside, and elsewhere wherever chaise lounges and 
recliners are available for use: "Never adjust chaise lounge or recliner 
headrests while seated. Serious finger, hand or other bodily injury may result 
from adjusting headrest while seated." 
Consider also including such notice in the written material(s) provided to 
guests in connection with the availability and use of the guest amenities at
