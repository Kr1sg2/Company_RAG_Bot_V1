cleaning and care
umbrellas
Always close market umbrellas and patio umbrellas in their stands when 
not in use. All Tropitone® umbrellas must always be closed and removed 
from service in windy conditions to protect umbrellas against damage from 
inclement weather, and to protect persons from potential injury due to 
umbrellas toppling or moving in such conditions. If market umbrellas or patio 
umbrellas become wet, open for a complete airing and make certain they are 
thoroughly dry before closing.
Occasional lubrication of the moving parts of market umbrellas and patio 
umbrellas with a silicon lubricant spray is recommended. 
caution: Do NOT get lubricant on fabric or finish.

If oxidation occurs, you may rub down the affected area with steel wool and 
follow up with a protective lubricant. Apply the protective lubricant, such as 
WD-40, to a cloth and then wipe onto the aluminum.

steel base plates

follow the instructions in the PAINTED FINISHES–TOUCHING UP SMALL NICKS
