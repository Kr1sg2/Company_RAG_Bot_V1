Windward Design Group’s strap collections are designed with the ever demanding elements of nature 
in mind.  We use 100% virgin, 2” vinyl and our strap pieces are doubled wrapped around the frame 
and fastened with nylon solid shank rivets, creating a stronger hold with enhanced reliability. We offer 
almost four dozen strap colors, unlimited color combinations, and numerous customization options.  In 
addition, many of our strap chaises include a safety feature to avoid finger pinching when adjusting the 
head rest position.  We also offer many chaise seat heights... 14.5”, 16” & even 18”!  So, no matter the 
application... whether your customer requires furniture for their beach concession, backyard pool, or 
retirement community, we have a strap collection to suit their needs.
