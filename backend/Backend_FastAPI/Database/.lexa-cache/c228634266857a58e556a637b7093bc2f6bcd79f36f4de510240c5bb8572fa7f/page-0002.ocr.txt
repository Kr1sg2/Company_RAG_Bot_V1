Company Overview:  Windward Design Group uses the highest quality materials available for 
outdoor furniture manufacturing.  All of our furniture is manufactured with commercial-grade, 
domestically milled, extruded aluminium.  Many of Windward’s extrusions are proprietary and have 
internal reinforcing ribs to provide the additional strength expected when purchasing a quality, 
domestically manufactured piece of outdoor furniture. 
From stainless steel hardware that will never rust or corrode, to our custom fit nylon glides that are 
color coordinated with our frame finishes, our attention to detail is reflected in each & every piece of 
furniture that we manufacture.  Another detail we incorporate into our manufacturing process is full 
circumference, heliarc welds for added strength and durability. 
To ensure lasting color and quality, our frames are sandblasted to create an ideal bonding surface.  This 
sandblasting preparation ensures your powder coated finish will not peel, or chip.  Once the frame has 
been prepared, a fine powder paint is oven-baked at temperatures reaching 400 degrees Fahrenheit to 
ensure even, complete coverage.  Our experienced staff works with only the most reputable powder
