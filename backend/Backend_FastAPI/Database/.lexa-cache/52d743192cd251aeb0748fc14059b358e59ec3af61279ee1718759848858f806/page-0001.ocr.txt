Cleaning and Removing Stains From Stone Tops 
1. Soak up liquid from the stain with paper towels. Remove as much from the surface as possible 
before working on the stain. 
2. Mix a few drops of mild dish-washing detergent with warm water in a bucket. Wet a sponge 
with the soapy solution before squeezing it out. Wipe the surface of your travertine tile to 
remove the stain from the surface. 
3. Pour 1 cup diatomaceous earth in a bowl. Mix in enough of one of the following liquids to make 
a thick, peanut-butter-like paste: water for greasy stains, hydrogen peroxide for organic stains, 
ammonia for biological stains and commercial rust remover for rust stains. Stir the two 
ingredients together with a spoon. 
4. Cover the site of the stain with the paste using a rubber spatula. Apply the paste so it's at least 
1/2-inch thick and goes beyond the edges of the stain. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over the paste. 
5. Allow the paste to sit on your travertine tile until it dries. Peel off the plastic wrap and remove 
the dried paste with your spatula. 
6. Dampen a clean cloth and wipe the travertine tiles. Dry with another clean cloth.
