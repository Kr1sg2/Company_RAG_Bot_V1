Do you know   Marine Grade Polymers? 
Marine Grade Polymer (MGP) will not swell, rot, warp, fade, splinter, or chemically breakdown even when exposed to 
humidity, water or sunlight. It is non-porous, scratch-resistant, and the color goes all the way through.  
What is Marine Grade Polymer?  
Marine Grade Polymer is High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and is made of 100% pure virgin plastic. It has been used in 
the boating industry for over 20 years and has proven itself to be extremely durable, requires very little maintenance, 
even in the harshest of environments.  
Manufacturers that use Marine Grade Polymer: 
Telescope Casual was the first company to begin using Marine Grade Polymer. Shortly thereafter Windward Design 
added it to their catalog. Both Windward and Telescope use the exact same type of Marine Grade Polymer, so there is no 
difference in the grade or quality between the 2 companies.   As a comparison, Telescope’s prices will typically be 20% 
higher than a similar size piece from Windward Design. Part of this is due to the transportation costs of bringing the 
Marine Grade Polymer material from Florida to upstate NY, where Telescope’s manufacturing facility is.  The 
manufacturer of the 
Marine Grade Polymer is actually located very close to Windward’s facility in Florida, so they enjoy a tremendous freight-
cost savings. This cost savings is passed along in the pricing of the product. 
What is the Difference between Marine Grade Polymer and Recycled Plastic? 
Recycled Plastic, which is strong and durable in its own right, does have some limitations due to the nature of the 
product. It is made using recycled plastic, and when co-mingling different types of plastics, there can be some 
incompatibility between them. This in turn creates some weaknesses in the recycled material that you will not find in 
Marine Grade Polymer.  As we have mentioned, Marine Grade Polymer is 100% pure virgin material, so it is much 
stronger structurally than recycled material. Recycled plastic has a lower strength to weight ratio than Marine Grade 
Polymer. There can also be a softening and weakening of recycled plastic at higher temperatures, and this will not occur 
with Marine Grade Polymer.  This is why you will see more structural reinforcement on furniture using recycled material. 
Recycled plastic is typically made to mimic natural lumber, and it is made into boards, like 2x4s. It has a “grainy” feel to 
it. Marine Grade Polymer is made into thinner, wider sheets, and has a much smoother feel to it than recycled plastic.
