Spills 
Even the hardest dried on spills are simple to resolve.  Most can be taken care of with a wet dish rag.  
Occasionally a little more effort is required.  For best results don't spot clean, clean the entire area.  
It is important to note that the table must be fully dry before making an evaluation on your efforts.  
Take the time to let the top completely dry before escalating your method.  Follow the grid below:
