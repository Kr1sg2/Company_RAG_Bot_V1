PoliSoul™ Furniture 
Some Garden Classics™ items contain PoliSoul Timber.  PoliSoul has grain and looks just like Mother 
Nature created it, but it has absolutely no wood in it.  Not a single tree was cut down to make PoliSoul 
Furniture.  This is hard to believe with how beautiful it is and the way it feels.   
 
Caution 
Do Not Place Hot Items on Surface 
Our beautiful PoliSoul Timber is not completely heat resistant.  Care should be taken to protect the 
surface of the material from fire, sparks, hot containers, or open flame.  Prolonged contact from a heat 
source can cause the surface to become shiney or melt and distort.
