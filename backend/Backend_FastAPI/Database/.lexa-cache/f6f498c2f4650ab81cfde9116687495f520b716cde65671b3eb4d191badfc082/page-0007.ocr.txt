Form Tab view or Unrolled View 
Each form in NetSuite contain a lot of information.  As you have learned earlier a form can be in Edit mode for 
editing and View mode for carrying a record to the next step.  You can also view the form in Edit or View mode in 
one of two formats.  Tab view, the screen is compressed, the sections are turned into tabs.  Unrolled view the 
page is stretched, and dark bars separate the sections as you move down the screen.  NetSuites default is 
Unrolled.  Unrolled is good for first time users Most users like Tab view.  You can toggle the view mode by clicking 
on the symbol that appears on the right of the bold lines when you hover over 
 or 
 on the right side of the 
line.
