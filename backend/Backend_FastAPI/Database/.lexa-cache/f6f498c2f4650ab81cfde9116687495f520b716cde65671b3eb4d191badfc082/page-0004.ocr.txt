Global Search 
What 
This is a search box that searches all of NetSuite.  Think of a Google search but only within the company 
information.  It is a very powerful tool.  Because it is so powerful it can be a bit overwhelming until you get the 
hang of it.  The same information as all of the other search fields throughout the NetSuite can be found by 
searching from global search field. 
Where 
The global search bar can be found at the top of every page in NetSuite or can be accessed by pressing <ALT> and 
<G> at the same time 
 
Advanced 
There are prefixes and symbols that can be used by advanced users to refine their search.  It is not necessary to 
learn these prefixes and symbols but if you do you will be able to find what you are looking for faster with fewer 
steps.  Tutorial documents and videos can be found on the internet by searching “NetSuite Global Search Tips & 
Tricks.”
