NetSuite is Thinking 
When using a computer, if it does not react immediately we often want to click again or take further action.  
NetSuite is a cloud (internet) based and it is important to wait and let it finish each action.  Because it is cloud 
based it may perform slower at times.  You can always tell if NetSuite is processing your request by looking at the 
header of your open web page.   
Waiting for Next Task 
When NetSuite has fully loaded the request and ready for the next task you will see the NetSuite Icon (
) in the 
top left on your current tab 
 
Busy Loading the Request 
When NetSuite is loading your request you will see a loading and a spinning arrow on the tab.  Clicking buttons 
and hitting keys will not speed it up.  Please note that even if the page is not blank, and the arrow is still spinning, 
NetSuite is still working. 
 
Some time there will be a “Waiting” message in the bottom left of your screen.
