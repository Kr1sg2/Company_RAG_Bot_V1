Why Are Rug Pads Needed- 
Without a rug pad, the life of your rug can decrease dramatically whether it’s on hardwood, carpet, or an outdoor patio.  
Rug pads extend the life of the rug and should be sold with every rug without an exception. 
Rug pads provide the following benefits: 
1.) Cushioning.  A rug pad adds softness to any rug and dampens noise. 
2.) Protection.  A rug pad under the rug prevents scratches and dye transfer to your floor or carpet below. 
3.) Longevity.  A rug pad acts as a buffer and prevents fibers from being crushed, therefore extending the life of 
your rug. 
4.) Safety.  A rug pad helps hold the rug in place, preventing slips. 
5.) Cleanliness.  A rug pad helps prevent the occurrence of mold, mildew and odors by allowing more air 
circulation, stopping buildup of bacteria under the rug.
