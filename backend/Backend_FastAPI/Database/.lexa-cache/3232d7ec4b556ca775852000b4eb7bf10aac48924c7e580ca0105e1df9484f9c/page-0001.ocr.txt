Why: 
Because there are so many benefits!  Rug sales are a great way to not only increase your average sale, but also 
offer a product to complete a customer’s vision for their new furniture. Area Rugs add pizazz to your customer’s 
space, create visual and physical warmth and add a great pop of color or pattern.  Rugs also help define spaces 
or areas.  Additionally, Rugs add comfort by softening hard surfaces.  They absorb and reduce ambient noise, 
and when used when the proper padding, provide a non-slip surface for floors and stairs. 
When: Leader’s Casual Furniture® sales team members should suggest rug add-ons on every sales opportunity.   
Who: All sales team members should embrace the opportunity to increase their average tickets by offering rugs during 
every furniture sale.
