o Cotton- A soft white fibrous substance that surrounds the seeds of a tropical and subtropical plant and is 
used as textile fiber and thread for sewing. 
 Natural Fiber rugs are flat-woven rugs, meaning they have no pile and are often reversible.  
Cotton is sometimes added for softness. 
 Able to hold a lot of varieties of dyes for extra color 
o Polypropylene- A synthetic resin that is polymer of propylene, used especially for ropes, fabrics, and 
molded objects. 
 Polypropylene rugs are commonly referred to by their generic name, olefin 
 Polypropylene rugs/olefin fiber is not as resilient as other fibers, meaning that it does not have 
the same ability to “bounce back” after being compressed by foot traffic 
 Polypropylene rugs are all solution dyed and can be cleaned with bleach 
 Polypropylene rugs are highly resistant to staining but not resistant to soiling 
 Polypropylene rugs attract oils and should not be used in dining rooms or areas susceptible to 
spills. 
 Polypropylene rugs are great for outdoor use as exposure to UV rays shouldn’t affect coloring 
 Polypropylene rugs dry quickly and are not prone to mold or mildew from moisture

synthetic textile fibers. 
  Polyester rugs typically are made up of many beautiful colors 
 Polyester rugs offer a high level of stain resistance 
 Polyester rugs are recommended for lower traffic areas

 Viscose Rugs are more commonly referred to as Rayon Rugs 
 Viscose Rugs are commonly very soft to the hand 
 Viscose Rugs are typically extremely absorbent 
 Viscose Rugs are the trickiest of all to clean as they lose tensile when wet, therefore many 
cleaners cause noticeable pile distortion 
 Viscose Rugs “crush” or “mat” easily therefore recommended use is in a low traffic area 
o Acrylic- Made from polymers of acrylic acid or acrylates. 
 Acrylic rugs are available in striking colors 
 Acrylic rugs offer good stain and soiling resistance 
 Acrylic rugs resist moths, chemicals, sunlight degradation, and oils.

areas
