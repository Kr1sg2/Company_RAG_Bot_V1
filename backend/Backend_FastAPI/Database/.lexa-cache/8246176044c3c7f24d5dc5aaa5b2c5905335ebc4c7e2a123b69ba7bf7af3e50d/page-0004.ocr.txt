You Can Relax, We Are Here to Help 
You bought the Protection Plus Extended Coverage Plan 
Your furniture is made for humid saltwater Florida environments.  Your cushions and frames are made 
to get wet and designed to be easy to clean.  All of our products are made from aluminum, stainless 
steel, and synthetic materials.  The Protection Plus Plan covers everything except organic growth and 
soil accumulation from neglect.  Our goal is to honor this expectation without being wasteful. 
A Little Effort Goes A Long Way – Let’s try together. 
At the time of purchase, you received an Ownership Packet to the email address you provided.  Please 
review the care instructions and let us know if you have any questions.  If you cannot get it clean 
following the care and maintenance instructions, please let us know, and we will be happy to help.   
Replacing an item instead of a little essential maintenance is bad for the environment.  Let’s try together 
first.
