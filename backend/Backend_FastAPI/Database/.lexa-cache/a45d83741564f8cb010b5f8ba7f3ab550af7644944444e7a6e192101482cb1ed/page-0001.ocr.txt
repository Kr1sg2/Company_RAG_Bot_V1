Cast Aluminum 
 
Supplies Needed 
1. Bucket or Spray bottle 
2. Soft Bristle Brush or Sponge 
3. Eye protection 
 
Cleaning & Maintenance  
 
Always wear eye protection to prevent foreign liquid or material from entering the eye. 
 
It is best to remove soiling and spills as they happen as they will be much easier to clean.  
This can be done by rinsing the product thoroughly with fresh water and brushing with a 
soft bristle brush if necessary. 
 
To remove stubborn dirt or stains from the frame or heavy soiling that has accumulated 
over time clean the frames with warm, soapy water and mild soap.  Brush with a soft bristle 
brush as necessary.  
 
In coastal areas near saltwater or near saltwater pools rinse the cast aluminum at least once 
a month, especially if it is under cover and not exposed to rain to reduce the salt buildup.  
Not rinsing off the buildup of salt will cause premature finish failure and will void the 
warranty. 
 
DO NOT USE A PREASSURE WASHER TO CLEAN YOUR FURNITURE.   
IT WILL VOID YOUR MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY. 
The force of the compressed water can damage or remove the finish. 
 
 
Cleaning & Maintaining the Cushions and Fabric 
 
Always wear eye protection to prevent foreign liquid or material from entering the eye. 
 
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the 
cushion on end to allow them to drain more quickly.  This will help prevent mold and 
mildew growth between the wicker frame and the cushion. 
 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm 
soapy solution of mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and 
rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD 
DAMAGE THE SEAMS OF THE CASE.
