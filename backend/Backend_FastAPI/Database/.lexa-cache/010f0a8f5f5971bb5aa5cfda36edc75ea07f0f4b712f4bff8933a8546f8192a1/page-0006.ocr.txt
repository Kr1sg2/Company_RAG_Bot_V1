1. The Firepit should be inspected and cleaned before initial use at least annually by a qualified field 
service person. 
2. Any component that is found faulty must be replaced with an approved component. 
3. Any tampering or modifying with the Firepit is dangerous and voids all warranties. 
4. During winter months in cold climates and various seasons, operation the Firepit may be affected 
by weather conditions.  It is recommended to use a ventilated cover over top of your Firepit to 
protect it from humid/rainy weather conditions when not in use.  Heavy rains/downpours could 
affect the Firepit operation if not covered; if this occurs ensure you allow the Firepit time to dry out 
before attempting to operate.  NOTE: If a combustible type cover is used over the Firepit when 
not in use be sure to remove it before operation to prevent a severe safety hazard. 
5. Carbon (soot) may build up on the surface of glass during normal use.   To clean, remove glass 
and wash with water, dry and replace. 
6. Over time stainless steel parts discolor when heated, usually a golden or brown hue.  This 
discoloration is normal and does not affect the performance of the appliance.
