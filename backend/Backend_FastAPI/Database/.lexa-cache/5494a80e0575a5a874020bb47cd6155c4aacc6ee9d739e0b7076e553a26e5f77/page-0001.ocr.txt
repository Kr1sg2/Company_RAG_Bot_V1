Vendor Certification 
Our long term vision is that every team member will need to “Vendor Certify” on a brand every year by a 
certain date.  The brands that a sales associate is vendor certified on they will make a higher commission 
rate than the vendors they are not certified on.  The program should be written in such a way that an 
associate can self-administer the education and hand in the accountability forms to be reviewed and 
scored by the sales leadership team.  A predetermined score must be achieved to earn the certification.
