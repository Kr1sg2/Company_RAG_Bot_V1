Lead GeneraƟon Email Templates 
These email templates are intended to be used with Outlook, not NetSuite.  It is easier to cut and paste 
images into Outlook.  These templates are a place to get started.  As you build your skills, you can create 
your own lead-generaƟon emails with a more personal touch. 
The most leads are generated with consistent, simple email contact and follow-up.  Make a list of 
properƟes and designers in your area that you plan on contacƟng regularly.  Start with the commercial 
property or design ﬁrm template below and add the correct branding and images for the property you 
are sending it to.  Copying and pasƟng images oﬀ the internet.  Seeing their property or their design ﬁrm 
name on their email will make you stand out and your target stop and read.
