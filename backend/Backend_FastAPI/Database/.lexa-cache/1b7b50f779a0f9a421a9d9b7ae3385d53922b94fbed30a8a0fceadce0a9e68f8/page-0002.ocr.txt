Why Do Commercial Partner Sales? 
 Commercial Partners (designers and commercial properƟes) regularly make new purchases.  
Reoccurring sales help hit KPI and accelerator goals. 
 The increased partner program sales raise your accelerator bonus.  A raised accelerator bonus 
increases your commissions on all delivered sales for the period.  The result is higher income for 
your eﬀort. 
 Commercial Partner sales are usually larger than average sales helping your locaƟon exceed KPI 
goals 
 Commercial Partner sales create excepƟonal markeƟng for residents living on the property, 
diners, or visitors to the commercial establishment
