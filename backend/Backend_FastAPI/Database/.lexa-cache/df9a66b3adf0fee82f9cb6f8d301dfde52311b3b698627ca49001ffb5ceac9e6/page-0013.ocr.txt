*From date of delivery is defined as the delivery when the product was first delivered to the purchaser.  It does not include any subsequent delivery for any 
additional item(s) or item(s) replaced under warranty.  Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for five years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of 
these mills and the mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make you new covers for your cushions.  If you would like 
complete new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade.
