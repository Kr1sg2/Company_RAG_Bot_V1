Introduction 
Since 2004, we've focused on only three things: making the very best poly furniture, figuring out how to make it 
even better, and providing customer service that no one can beat.  That's the Lancaster, PA way.  Our area has 
become world-famous for doing things right, and we don't plan to tarnish that reputation.  It's a tall order that's 
not easy to live up to, but we haven't backed down from it yet.  Our poly furniture is meticulously handcrafted 
by expert artisans who are passionate about their work and never cut corners.  We're constantly on the lookout 
for ways to improve. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Skilled Amish artisans patiently cut and assemble every detail to perfection. 
Hardware 
 
We only use the very best Allochrome 1500+™, which outlasts 316 and 304 stainless.  If you live near the 
salty ocean air, relax, your Casual Comfort Furniture™ can withstand the environment. 
Material 
 
Poly lumber is made from High Density Polyethylene, a recycled plastic that will never need to be 
painted or stained.  The durability and longevity of poly lumber is unparalleled.  Poly lumber is a strong 
material with the ability to bear significant weight, is impervious to insects, and resists warping and 
fading. 
Construction 
 
We continually learn and take steps to make our furniture better than any other poly furniture 
manufacturer.  We reinforce our tabletops with an aluminum substructure to prevent any possibility of 
warping on hot sunny days.  We also, do our best to hide as many screws as possible.  Internally hidden 
screws are not any easy task and many poly furniture manufacturers do not take the time or trouble to 
do so.  Secured by no-show screws, Casual Comfort furniture is designed to fit together precisely.  Each 
cut is accurate, each screw straight and tight.  Edges are routed to avoid annoying roughness that would 
spoil your outdoor experience.  Closely inspect our products, your new furniture, and you will see that 
we have paid the utmost attention to details during assembly and finishing.
