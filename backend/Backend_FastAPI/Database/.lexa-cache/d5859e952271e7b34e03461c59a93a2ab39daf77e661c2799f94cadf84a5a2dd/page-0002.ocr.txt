Safety 
The safety of our teams and guests is paramount.  If any situation is observed that could potentially be unsafe for any 
reason, please call a member of Sales Leadership and follow up with email sales.leadership@leadersfurniture.com  
Interior 
Cleaning 
The interior of every Showroom should be cleaned by the dedicated cleaning company every other week.  If the 
cleaning service did not cover all items on the check list or you are not satisfied with their 
job, please share with them what you would like them to do in a polite way.  The company will not get paid if 
you do not sign off. Your store’s team is responsible for the quality of the job performed. 
Lighting (Interior) 
It is important to have a well-lit store.  Interior lighting is evaluated on all store visits and on the Store 
Evaluation. 
Air Conditioning 
Before calling an air conditioning service provider, please review the basics of the concern. 
✓ Is the thermostat on? 
✓ Is the thermostat set to a temperature that is lower than the air temperature? 
✓ Are all units on in the building? 
HVAC Systems work by taking in warm air and letting out cooler air. The difference in the temperature of the 
air going in and the air coming out is called the differential.  The air coming out of the a/c vent should be 
between 14 to 20 degrees cooler than the air going into the air return. 
Windows 
The interior windows of the showroom windows should be cleaned twice a year.  Please use the check list that 
can be found here: (R:\8 About Store Procedures\2.0 General Store Procedure\8.25 Windows Check List). 
Plumbing 
Emergency 
If water is leaking uncontrollably, the situation is a risk to safety, or it has rendered the restrooms in 
operable, call a Sales Leadership team member and find a highly rated local service 
provider. Please see “Finding a Local Service Provider” later in this procedure. 
Non-Emergency 
For all other non-emergencies, like plunging or a leaky flapper, the store team should attempt to 
remediate the concern in a safe way.  If the store team does not have the skill or knowledge, please 
submit a Maintenance Request.
