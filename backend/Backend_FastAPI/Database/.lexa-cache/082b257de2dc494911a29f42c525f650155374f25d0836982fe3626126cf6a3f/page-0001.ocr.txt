History of Leader’s Holding Company & Leader’s Casual Furniture® 
Established in 1971 in the heart of the fast growing West Florida market, Leader's Casual 
Furniture® was founded in a small converted house in St. Petersburg, Florida by Marvin Johnson 
and Floyd Crater under the name Casual Furniture.  Marvin and Floyd started their career in the 
furniture industry at Kane’s.  In 1971 casual furniture was a unique 
category that no other company focused on.  As the category 
gained popularity many companies came up with similar names 
and copied the format of Casual Furniture.  To combat the “me 
too” competition the management team at Casual Furniture 
legally changed the name to Leader’s Casual Furniture®.
