Quality. Style. Comfort. Relentless Innovation. 
A Material Difference 
From the early days of outdoor furniture manufacturing, the search for and discovery of attractive, durable 
materials plays a critical role in success. Tropitone has used to the highest quality materials from the beginning. 
These materials are specifically suited to the form and function of each product. 
Beautiful, pure aluminum for the finest detail. Most appealing and weather resistant fabrics. More durable and UV-
resistant vinyl straps. Stainless steel fasteners, hardware and fittings. High-density nylon bushings and glides.
