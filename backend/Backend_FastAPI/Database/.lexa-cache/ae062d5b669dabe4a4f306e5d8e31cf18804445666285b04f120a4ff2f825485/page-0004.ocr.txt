Family Leadership since 1954. 
In 1954 Bert M. Baker, a retired engineer from the Grand Rapids Chair Co. and 
former engineer for Lockheed Aircraft, moved to Sarasota, Florida. Mr. Baker, an 
energetic, creative sort (some even say restless) soon became bored with 
retirement and bought a small, local company - the Sarasota Redwood Furniture 
Company.  
Drawing upon his experience in both the furniture and aircraft industries (and his 
knowledge of aluminum!) Mr. Baker soon switched from redwood to welded 
aluminum for his outdoor furniture construction. He renamed the company 
Tropitone.  
From this humble beginning, an industry leader was born. 
The goals of Mr. Baker and his family remained the same for over 50 years. Provide casual outdoor patio furniture 
with a total commitment to quality, style and comfort. And price them to provide a good value. In other words, build 
timeless quality that can only come from materials, design and technology that deliver the ultimate outdoor patio 
furniture. It didn't take long for buyers to realize that Tropitone furniture was so good, it was an excellent value for 
hotels & clubs and houses & apartments. 
Early on, the Baker family also recognized the value of quality customer service. That service begins with an in-
depth understanding of your needs. In the commercial market, this has meant responding to rigorous requirements 
for amazingly stylish and durable outdoor patio furniture. Meeting those requirements for commercial customers 
allowed us to offer significant advances in quality, styling and comfort in outdoor furniture for the home, as well. In 
both the commercial and consumer markets, many of our independent sales representatives and dealers have 
been with us for generations. They have always offered in-depth knowledge and personalized service aimed at 
first making sure we understand your needs. They then make sure you are aware of the vast range of design 
choices we make available to meet you needs. 
This commitment to meeting your requirements has inspired Tropitone to pioneer many design and manufacturing
innovations. These innovations translate into more style, more quality and more comfort. And today, Tropitone 
continues to be a leader in the design and craftsmanship of fine outdoor patio furnishings. 
Tropitone innovations include … acrylic tabletops … wider aluminum extrusions for arm comfort and strength…the 
first quick-drying, weather-resistant outdoor cushions … double-wrapped vinyl straps …tube-in-tube construction 
… stainless hardware and fittings … strikingly realistic faux-stone and tile tabletops …highly detailed, hefty cast or 
extruded aluminum frames! And there are many more examples - including, of course, being the first outdoor patio 
furniture manufacturer to use powder coating to finish our frames. That was way back in 1969 … 10 years before
everyone else in the industry followed our lead. In fact, Tropitone has created more quality, style and comfort 
breakthroughs in aluminum outdoor patio furniture than any other company. 
The original Mr. Baker eventually turned over leadership of Tropitone to his son, James Baker, who continued the 
Tropitone tradition of design leadership. 
Design leadership that helped Tropitone win numerous awards and honors from the design community. Including 
major awards in our industry such as the Apollo, the IBD Contract, the ROSCOE. Even the famous Sisel Vert 
French design award. 
Style, indeed a multitude of styles, that you can make your own with a wide range of fabrics and finishes. So many 
choices that it's not much of an exaggeration to say that nearly every piece of Tropitone furniture is custom made. 
Not to mention hand crafted right here in the U.S.A. in both California and Florida.
