Uncompromising Craftsmanship 
While great design and quality materials create the potential for beauty, craftsmanship determines whether that 
potential is achieved. That's why every piece of Tropitone furniture is hand crafted and hand finished. It begins 
by shaping or casting the highest quality aluminum into the frame … the foundation of our furniture. Elegance 
and beauty are applied to the surface of our frames with hand applied powder coat finishes and patinas. 
Durability supports beauty with our tube-within-a-tube frame construction, full circumference welds and double 
wrapped vinyl strapping. Beauty meets comfort with our hand tailored cushions and sling seats. Regardless of 
the design you select, you can be sure that every piece of our outdoor furniture is touched only by people who 
care. People who are masters of their craft. People who take the time to do the job right. And it shows. In 
furniture that's beautiful the first day, and even more beautiful as each passing day reveals its timeless quality. 
 
The Finishing Touch 
The search for beauty is not complete until the final stages of the finishing 
process. With that in mind, Tropitone works side-by-side with our select 
suppliers to custom-create every finish we offer. We collaborate with our fabric 
designers to carefully select our continuously-updated offering of more than 200 
outdoor fabrics that fit our vision for style & comfort. All fabrics have been 
rigorously tested for durability and weather resistance. 
Tropitone is a pioneer in the development of the powder coat finishing process. 
We introduced the finishing technique to the aluminum outdoor patio furniture
industry in 1969. Most recently, we have implemented a multi-step wash process 
that guarantees an even longer lasting finish than before. We also continue to 
offer an ever-increasing palette of colors, styles and a texture ranging from sleek 
contemporary metallic’s to charming antique patinas. Once the hallmark of a few 
small custom shops, these remarkable finish colors and textures add a deeply 
sophisticated design element  
to outdoor rooms in styles from the most elegant traditional to the most daring contemporary. 
Tropitone is continuing our history of design and quality innovation with our new Color Families of outdoor furniture 
fabrics. These collections of coordinated fabrics will inspire even the most experienced designer, and allow our 
customers to achieve sophisticated outdoor furniture environments with the help of our exclusive dealers. These 
evocative collections of texture, style and color are sure to stimulate creativity. The continuously-updated 
collections of more than 200 choices will give you just the look you want for all your outdoor patio furniture 
including fabrics for chair slings, chair cushions and market umbrellas. Nine complete collections await your 
consideration … sleek, metropolitan Silver Lining … fresh, inviting Cool Hues … luxurious, indulgent Rich 
Chocolate. Quality is style. Style is comfort. Comfort is quality. Relentless Innovation.
