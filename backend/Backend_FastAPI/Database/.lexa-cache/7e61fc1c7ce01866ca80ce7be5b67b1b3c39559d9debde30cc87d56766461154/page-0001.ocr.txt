Wind Damage:
Treasure Garden highly recommends that no umbrella, regardless of size or 
weight, ever be left unattended in the open position. In windy conditions, it 
is further recommended that umbrellas be closed, removed from their base, 
and stored or laid horizontally. This will reduce the risk of personal injury, 
damage to your umbrella, furniture, and other belongings or property. To 
ensure stability of your umbrella, please observe proper placement, and use
