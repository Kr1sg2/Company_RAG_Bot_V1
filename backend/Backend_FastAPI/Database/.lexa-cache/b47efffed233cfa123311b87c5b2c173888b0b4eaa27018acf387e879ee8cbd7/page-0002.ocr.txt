Caution  
Do Not Place Hot Items On Surface 
Our beautiful PoliSoul Timber is not completely heat resistant.  Care should be taken to protect the surface of the 
material from fire, sparks, hot containers, or open flame.  Prolonged contact from a heat source can cause the surface to 
become shinny or melt and distort. 
Personal Protection  
When you perform maintenance and cleaning always keep safety in mind.  Protect your eyes and skin 
from chemicals by using eye protection, protective clothing, and gloves.  When using any type of 
cleaner, especially bleach, do so in a well ventilated area.
