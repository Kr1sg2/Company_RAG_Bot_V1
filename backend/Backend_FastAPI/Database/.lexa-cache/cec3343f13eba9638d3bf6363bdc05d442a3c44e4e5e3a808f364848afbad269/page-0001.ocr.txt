CARE AND MAINTENANCE
FRAMES
Cleaning: Use mild soap and warm water. Do not use abrasive materials, cleansers or bleach
products. Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly.
Maintenance: Periodically clean chairs and dry thoroughly. Drain any water accumulated
inside the frames by removing the adjuster glides or foot caps from the bottom of the legs.
WARNING :Water allowed to accumulate inside the frames and then exposed to freezing
temperatures can cause damage to the frames. Such damage is not covered under warranty.
Always clean, drain and dry thoroughly before storing for the winter. Maintain glossy finishes
by applying a coat of high quality auto wax after cleaning. Do not use wax on textured or
matte finishes. For best results, always store or cover your furniture with outdoor furniture
covers when not in use. Covers not included.
FABRIC (SLINGS)
Cleaning: Wipe minor spills immediately. Clean with mild soap, warm water and soft cloth.
Although the fabric has been treated to resist  stains, over time it may be necessary to  use
stain removers. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
Maintenance: The best way to maintain the beauty of your furniture is to store them in a dry
area out of extreme temperatures or severe weather. If your furniture is being used in areas
where birds and trees are plentiful, covering your furniture is especially recommended.
