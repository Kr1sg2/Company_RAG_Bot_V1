7.5 Do You Know About Aluminum 
11/28/2017 
Where does Aluminum come from?   
Aluminum is found naturally in combination with over 270 different minerals and does not occur often 
in nature as a free metal. Out of those 270 minerals it is not economically feasible to extract the pure 
aluminum from the large majority of them. Instead almost all metallic aluminum is produced from 
bauxite ore. Bauxite ore is formed by the decomposition of 
earth’s rocks and soil, known as bedrock, in tropical 
climates. The primary mining areas for this special ore is 
Indonesia, Ghana, Jamaica and portions of Russia.  Because 
of the high amount of energy need to chemically extract 
aluminum, compared to most metals, it is extracted in a 
non-traditional process using heat. Electrolysis is the 
specialized process in which the ore is dissolved into a 
molten material that reduces it into pure aluminum. This 
process is only possible because of aluminum’s unique 
melting point. The energy needed to extract aluminum 
represents 20-40% of its cost; therefore most aluminum is produced only where electric power is 
plentiful and the most inexpensive.    
What are the major uses of aluminum? 
One of the most widely used metals; global production of this material exceeded that of any other metal 
except iron in 2005. It is used not only in furniture making, but also in household wiring, automotive and 
aircraft construction along with building construction, food canning and countless other fields.   
How is Aluminum Recycled?  
The most valuable beverage container to recycle, the aluminum can is only 
one of many kinds of scrap aluminum that can be re- cycled and re-used 
into the production of new products. Aluminum recycling has been a 
common practice since the early 1900s and is a fairly straightforward 
process in comparison to making new… simply melt the old metal. Because 
of the significant cost savings in the energy needed to recycle old 
aluminum, close to one-third of all the aluminum produced in the United 
States comes from recycled scrap.
