Coastal Exposure 
Living the coastal lifestyle is a dream for many, but living the dream and living near the saltwater can be 
a challenge for anything left outside.  The salt in the humid air takes a toll on everything from the 
exterior of your home, your car, and your outdoor furniture.  The best preventative maintenance you 
can do for your outdoor furniture while living near the coast, is to rinse it regularly with a hose to 
remove the salt and apply corrosion block to all metal surfaces and painted metal surfaces quarterly.  
Any nonmetal surface should be sprayed quarterly with Turtle Wax Ice, following the directions on the 
bottle. 
Cleaning - What to Use 
Frames 
Nothing is better than a periodic rinse and if necessary using car wash soap or dish soap 
and a sponge to remove soiling.  If your frames require a more thorough cleaning the 
best product to use for soiling is Simple Green®.  If you have mold and mildew stains you 
can use a solution as strong as straight bleach to clean them.  Please be careful to use 
appropriate protection and to protect clothing and other fabrics in the area. 
Casual Comfort™ product is about as durable as it gets.  For stubborn soiling or a more 
vigorous periodic rinse you can use up to a 1,600psi pressure washer with the 25° or 
wider nozzle.   
Cushions 
After a soaking rain or anytime the cores of the cushions get wet it is best to stand the cushion on end to 
allow them to drain more quickly.  This will prevent mold and mildew growth between the frame and the 
cushion. 
Spot wash the fabric to clean spills by using a sponge or a soft bristle brush with a warm soapy solution of 
mild detergent (Joy or Ivory liquid).  Brush or sponge the soiled area and rinse thoroughly with fresh water.  
Allow to air dry.  Repeat if necessary. 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE THE SEAMS 
OF THE CASE. 
If, and only if your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may use 1 
part bleach mixed with 1 part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions.  Check a small 
inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion.  Be sure to rinse the cushion 
thoroughly to remove all of the bleach solution.
