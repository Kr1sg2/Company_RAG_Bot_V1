Product Inspection 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Inspections must include, 
but not be limited to, joint tightness, spring assemblies and the weld areas of the product’s, arms and legs.  If 
joints are loose, or any cracks should appear on the product or at welds, the item must immediately be removed 
from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing hardware 
be detected, the item must be removed from service immediately until the hardware 
can be properly tightened and/or replaced.  
Inspections must also include chaise lounge and recliner headrest ratchets.  
Periodically tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise lounges and recliners.  Confirm all 
other hardware is tight, movement is smooth without binding, and that the ratchet 
engages properly at each position.  At the same time, carefully inspect the headrest 
ratchets for breakage and/or wear. If headrest ratchet breakage and/or indications of 
headrest ratchet wear are present, a replacement headrest should be ordered and the 
furniture must immediately be removed from service until repaired and/or replacement parts are installed. 
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS AND ACCESSORIES section of this 
brochure. 
Product failure caused by a lack of the reasonable, but necessary care and maintenance is not covered by the 
product warranty.
