Decision Table Definitions 
➢ Decision Table - Illustrative of the path of a potential customer from their initial entry into 
NetSuite or in the case of an add-on from a previous purchase. 
➢ Customer Stage - Represents the stage that the potential customer is at in our NetSuite CRM 
(Customer Relationship Management) pipeline or their status after their initial purchase and 
they choose to “Add On” additional purchase(s) at a later date.  
➢ Add On - Defined as the same customer returning to purchase “any” additional product after 
their initial purchase. 
➢ Salesperson & Store – The prefix “Yes” or “No” in front of either the Salesperson or Store 
represents “Whose Sale Is It” or who gets credit for the sale.  For example, E-commerce – NO 
Salesperson, YES – Store by Customer Address = the Salesperson does not get credit for the sale, 
but the Store does and which store is determined by the customer’s address.  The store closest 
to the customers address will get credit for the sale. 
➢ 90 Days – Is the established and defined timeframe attached to a customer, or potential 
customer, from the initial entry into the Customer Stage until purchase.  For example, an 
Opportunity, Quote or Add On is valid, and attached to, the original salesperson for a 90-day 
period.  After the 90-day period any purchase made by a customer is not guaranteed to the 
original salesperson.
