Guidelines & Rules 
➢ Once you have completed the Leaders Essentials Book you are eligible to write sales under your 
name and begin earning commission. 
➢ All information, regardless of the Customer Stage, must be entered into NetSuite to qualify. 
➢ The customer is the ultimate decision maker.  At any time during the Customer Stage if the 
customer requests or chooses to work with another team member, other than the original 
salesperson, we as a team will honor the customers decision.  When this situation occurs Sales 
Leadership must be contacted and alerted of the customers decision. 
➢ Individual showroom rules or side deals amongst sales team members are not permissible and 
at no time take precedent over the Whose Sale Is It guidelines and rules. 
➢ All Quotes that change salesperson are automatically reported by NetSuite to the Sales 
Leadership Team.  The Sales Leadership Team reviews the report regularly.  If you have any 
concern, please contact the Sales Leadership Team.
