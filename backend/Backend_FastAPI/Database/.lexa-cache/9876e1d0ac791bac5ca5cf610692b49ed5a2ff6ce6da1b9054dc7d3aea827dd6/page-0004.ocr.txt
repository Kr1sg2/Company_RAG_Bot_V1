Don’t over complicate things.  For a large percentage of our sales, we are helping customers design their 
outdoor patios, balconies, and lanais. Generally, these are rectangular or square spaces without too 
many limitations/structural objections.  The “Create your own plan” is a good option in these situations. 
The Pre-Programmed templates have many built in, editable, structures such as windows, doors, closets 
etc. This is very helpful when configuring an indoor area.  Choose a pre-programmed room when 
working with a customer on their indoor space.

mouse.
