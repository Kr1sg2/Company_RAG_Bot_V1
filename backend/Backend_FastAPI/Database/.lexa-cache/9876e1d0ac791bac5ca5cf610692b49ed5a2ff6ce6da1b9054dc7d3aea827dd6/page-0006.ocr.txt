2. Suppose customer would like the Lakeside Cushion Loveseat by Tropitone which is not loaded 
on the room planner.   You’ll need to pull up Tropitone’s website or Pricelist to get dimensions. 
From the Symbols Tab, Furniture, Living Room- select contemporary Loveseat.  Click on the item 
to allow for you to edit the dimensions.  Put in the dimensions of the Lakeside Cushion Loveseat. 
3. Add stock piece, 42” Round Marine Grade Polymer Firepit to the room design in front of the 
loveseat.  This firepit can be found under the Products tab under Outdoor Seating.   
Furniture pieces can be added by selecting from the Products tab on the left side of the page.   
It is very important to understand the distance between pieces to allow space for walking and normal 
everyday living.  The Room Planner has a built in measuring tool to help guide you in placing furniture 
with proper distance between.  
  Select the ruler icon from the menu bar.  To measure, simply click 
the two points you’d like to take the measurement between.   
4. Measure the distance between the Loveseat and Firepit, you should have at least 1’6” of space.  
Move pieces around until you’re able to create this space. 
5. Print and Save this Room design as “Focus 2”
