High Back Chair, Ottoman, Rattan Swivel Rocker, Cocktail Table, (2) End Tables.

Add Flare/Personalize!   
There are built in icons such as landscape, windows, people, animals etc.  These are a fun touch to 
add to make the document seem more realistic and personalized. Example- Did you hear the 
customer say they need an ottoman for their dog?  Go ahead and add a dog on the ottoman in the 
room design plan!  Your customer will love this! 
4. 
Select from the Symbols Tab, under Miscellaneous, People/Animals, a dog of your choice 
and place into room design. 
5. 
Save and Print your design!  If you don’t already have one, you will need to set yourself up 
with an account on Leader’s website, so you can access these designs at a later date.  Please 
save the plan with title “Focus Bali”
