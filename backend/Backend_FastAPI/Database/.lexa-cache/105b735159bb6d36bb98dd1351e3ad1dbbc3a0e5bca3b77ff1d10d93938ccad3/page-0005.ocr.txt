Safety  
In our continuing effort to ensure that your experience with your new purchase is positive with 
regard to comfort, quality and design, we take safety very seriously.  Please note the following 
important safety information, in addition to any other safety information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of damaged furniture can 
result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if unaddressed, can become major repair and service issues that 
can create potential safety issues.  Contact the Leader Furniture® Solutions Center for support at 
solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com  
Product Inspection 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Inspections must include, 
but not be limited to, joint tightness, spring assemblies, and the weld areas of the product’s, arms and legs.  If 
joints are loose or any cracks should appear on the product or at welds, the item must immediately be removed 
from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing hardware be 
detected, the item must be removed from service immediately until the hardware can 
be properly tightened and/or replaced.  
Inspections must include chaise lounge and recliner headrest ratchets.  Periodically 
tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise lounges and recliners.  Confirm all other 
hardware is tight, movement is smooth without binding, and that the ratchet engages 
properly at each position.  At the same time, carefully inspect the headrest ratchets for 
breakage and/or wear.  If headrest ratchet breakage and/or indications of headrest 
ratchet wear are present, a replacement headrest should be ordered.  The furniture 
must immediately be removed from service until repaired and/or replacement parts installed. 
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS AND ACCESSORIES section of this 
brochure. 
Product failure caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and maintenance is not covered by the product 
warranty. 
Contact the Leaders Furniture® Solutions Center immediately if you notice concerns.

Safety Warning!  Chaise lounge and recliner headrests must NEVER be adjusted while seated in the chaise.  Serious 
finger, hand or other bodily injury may result from adjusting the headrest while seated.  Headrests must always be 
adjusted while out of the furniture and standing to the side.
