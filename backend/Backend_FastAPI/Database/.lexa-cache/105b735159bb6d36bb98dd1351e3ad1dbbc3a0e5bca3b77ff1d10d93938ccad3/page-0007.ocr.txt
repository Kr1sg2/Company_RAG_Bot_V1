Water Line 
Using your product for a prolonged period of time in water will develop a water line that cannot be 
removed on the product.  It is ok to use the product in the water and it will not hurt it, it will just 
develop a visible line. 
Chalky Residue 
After unpacking of your new furniture, on some rare occasions, your furniture may have chalky 
residue that's more visible on darker colors.  This is the polypropylene (resin) reacting to the sudden 
temperature and pressure change and it's totally normal.  It can be easily wiped with Windex®, hand 
sanitizers or any mild cleaning detergent like soap and water.  Usually one or two rounds of wipe 
down with clean soft cloth will take care of this residue. 
*** DO NOT USE cleaners with bleach or ammonia *** 
Once you wipe it clean, your furniture will not have this chalky residue again. 
Cleaning 
These products will not fade under sun during regular use.  Products might incur change in color if 
exposed to outside pollutants.  This can be but not limited to: Abrasive cleaning products containing 
bleach, ammonia etc., pesticides sprinkled or sprayed, months long exposure of snow with air 
pollutants, animal droppings uncleaned, food and drinks that are not cleaned in a timely manner. 
Bleach is widely used in US households. But when it comes to outdoor furniture and especially 
polypropylene furniture, it's a no no. Unfortunately bleach hurts polypropylene material and can have 
effects on your furniture that would make you regret. So, please refrain from using bleach and any 
other strong chemicals for cleaning purposes. 
The best way to clean these products are with lots of water, possibly hosing down or wiping with wet 
cloth.  You can use mild soaps to clean persistent stains.  Dawn or Windex seems to be working 
well.
