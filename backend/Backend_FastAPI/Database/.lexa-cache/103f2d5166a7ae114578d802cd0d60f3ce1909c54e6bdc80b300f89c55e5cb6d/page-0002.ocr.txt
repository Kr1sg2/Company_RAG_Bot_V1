a. Not to worry.  Leaders keeps all customer records and we can simply reprint it for them.

the same Sales Order as the Protection Plus Plan SKU’s.

residential use only and not for a rental/investment property. 
b. Contract Sales cannot purchase the Protection Plus Plan. 
7. What Happens If the Customer Has A Claim? 
a. The customer should notify a Leaders team member so we can open a Solutions Center 
case.  The Solutions Center will help them get the information together to file a case.  
Leaders will have the final say in covering the customer.  
b. If the concern cannot be corrected the item will be replaced. 
i. The replacement item that the claim was on no longer carries an accident 
forgiveness plan.  The covered item is not eligible for a new or additional 
protection plan.  All other items are still fully covered. 
8. What if the item cannot be cleaned or fixed and the item is not currently available?

product with a similar item, offer a store credit, or refund the customer the purchase 
price before tax and delivery.

a. If an item is exchanged and it does not relate to the Plus Plan extended coverage, the 
Plus Plan extended coverage will remain in effect on the item from the initial first 
delivery date of the original item.
