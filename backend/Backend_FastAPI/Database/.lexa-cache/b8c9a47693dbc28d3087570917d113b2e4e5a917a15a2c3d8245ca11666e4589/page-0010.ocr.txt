“Mrs. Smith, I am going to end the conversation now.  Please take a minute and call me 
back when can speak to me with respect.  I will follow up with you if I do not here from 
you in 24 hours.” 
Step 2 If the customer continues, or calls and continues to be disrespectful contact your 
supervisor to take care of the situation.  If your supervisor is not available contact a 
member of the sales management team, customer’s service or Leader’s Casual 
Furniture® Staff to communicate with the customer.
