more.

Jane’s sling fabric is sagging 
after use. 
 
x 
Sling fabric is a wear item.  In most cases the 
sling will return to shape after it has not 
been sat on for an hour.  It will eventually 
stretch.  The good news is it can be replaced, 
and you can sell the customer new slings.  
The average life of a sling is 5 to 7 years 
outside.
