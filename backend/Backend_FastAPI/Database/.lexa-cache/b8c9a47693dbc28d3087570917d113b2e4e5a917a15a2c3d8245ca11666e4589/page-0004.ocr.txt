2.51 Solutions Center Service Case 
6/9/2019 
Preparing the Customer for a Fast Trouble-Free Service 
Leader’s Casual Furniture’s top priority is our customers.  We want to always exceed expectations.  Never 
commit to an action you are unsure of.  Never over promise.  Never say something to make the customer 
go away.  We only want to tell the truth.  If you are unsure simply tell the customer: 
“Thank you for the opportunity you are giving us.  We will make every reasonable effort to 
resolve your concern to keep you happy.  Our goal is always 100% customer satisfaction.  Please 
allow our customer service professionals to contact you to best resolve your concern.”
