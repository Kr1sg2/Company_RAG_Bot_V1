Fabric Protection (FABP-) 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® offers our customers a “wet applied” fabric protection program.  The product   
applied works so well; we decided to insure it ourselves.  Bringing the program in-house allows us to 
give even better customer service because there is no third party involved in helping the customer.  
Please read the card thoroughly and understand how the program works.   
How to sell Fabric Protection: 
Sales professionals who discuss the features and benefits of Fabric protection in the beginning of the sale 
sell more.  Don’t wait to present Fabric Protection at the end, because at this point it is most often too 
late.  The customer has become comfortable with the cost of the furniture and is not willing to discuss 
any additional expense.  Remember, not only will you get paid 15% commission on your fabric protection 
sales; it truly is a benefit to our customers! 
The vendor code for our Fabric Protection is FABP-.  It is considered a bulk item; therefore it is not 
serialized.  FABP- is priced $10 per cushion.  Indoor Protection is covered by a 4-year warranty.  Fabric 
protection on outdoor product gives the same benefits as using it indoor and has no warranty.  To 
differentiate two different SKU’s are used. 
SKU’s for Fabric Protection

Why sell Fabric Protection on Outdoor cushions 
Fabric protection sold on outdoor cushions has no warranty, but it does provide a customer with 
advantages.  Fabric Protection applied to outdoor cushions will increase the amount of time before the 
customers first cleaning.  It is important to note if left untouched, cushions will eventually get dirty and 
mildew.  While Fabric Protection does have UV inhibitors, slow fading in direct sunlight is normal and 
should be expected.  Fabric Protection does not prevent the need to clean cushions.  It is important to not 
mislead our customers. 
Oversized Items 
Want to sell fabric protection on oversized outdoor items like rugs and charge more?  By request of the 
sales team there is an oversized SKU.  FABP-Outdoor,Oversize at a $20 value.
