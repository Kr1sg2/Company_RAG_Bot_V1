Delivery Override 
“Delivery Override” 
Delivery Override is a situation in which a customer will receive a piece of furniture with known issues.   Before a piece 
of furniture with known issues can be delivered to a Customer, we must have permission from the Customer. Only 
Managers and Customer Service & Support staff members can override a Delivery Driver’s authority to deliver a piece of 
furniture with known issues.  This form must be filled out and signed before the furniture is delivered.  This form 
releases the Delivery Driver from being held accountable for the Clean Stop and Clean Pieces being delivered on this 
invoice.
