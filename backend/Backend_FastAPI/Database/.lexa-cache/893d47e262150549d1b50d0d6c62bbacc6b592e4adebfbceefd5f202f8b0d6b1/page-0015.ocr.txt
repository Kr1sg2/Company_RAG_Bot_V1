Prepping and Manufacturing 
Rattan furniture factories in the orient usually are not the typical 
structures one thinks of in North America.  More often they are simply 
posts in the ground with a roof â€“ open on all sides.  This highly ventilated 
design permits good air circulation to help combat high temperatures and 
humidity that prevails much of the time in these areas.  When it rains, 
and it does with a vengeance, things get wet but, when the rain stops 
everything dries very quickly.  
When the poles are received at the factory they are fumigated, then 
stood on end for curing.  Cured poles are sorted into bundles of uniform 
size and graded according to quality and color.  Next the tough outer 
surface is carefully hand stripped to a precise depth and the surface 
material removed. The stripped poles are then carefully hand sanded and 
cut to appropriate lengths to be formed into frame parts. 
Frame are formed using handmade jigs.  Though these jigs appear crude, but they are made with great 
accuracy by skilled artisans in order for the part to be formed into an exact shape.  Prior to forming, poles 
are heated with a blow torch or steamed in a drum which makes them temporarily very pliable for 
inserting into the jig.  When cooled, the parts retain the shape of the jig.  The formed parts are then joined 
to make the piece of furniture using screws and glue, with joints wrapped in leather for additional strength 
and an attractive appearance. 
Better wicker furniture is made of rattan core.  Rattan core is 
produced by pulling small diameter rattan stems through a 
special knife that shapes the core to 1/8-inch diameter 
strands.  These strands of rattan core are very strong yet 
flexible for wicker furniture.   
In brief, this is the story of rattan from the forest to the 
completed product; but this is a two-part story.  The second 
and most important part concerns the use of rattan furniture 
and the effect it has on the people who live with it. 
It is well known that a relationship exists between people and 
the environment they inhabit.  Colors, forms, and textures can be artfully combined to create an 
atmosphere that will affect the mood of a person, and today, the atmosphere desired is one of leisure 
and tranquility.  To achieve this goal designers are turning more and more frequently to wicker and rattan 
home furnishings. 
What makes Rattan "Green"? 
Rattan vines are fast-growing, they are a natural renewable resource.  The growth of rattan vines depends 
on healthy trees, instead of depleting them.  Therefore, harvesting rattan cane provides a profitable 
"green" alternative to timber logging.  Because trees are left standing when rattan is harvested, the raw 
material can be classified as a non-forest product.
