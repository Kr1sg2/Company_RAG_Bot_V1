6/15/2019 
Getting Started 
Using the Guest Look Up portal 
1. To get started, from the NetSuite Home Screen Click the “Guest Lookup” portal or from the 
Global Search. 
 
 
2. You should see the screen below.  You can search by Email, Phone Number, Last Name, or 
Company Name.  You can search with partial information if the guest cannot remember the 
specifics.  You can also change the filters on how the search is conducted but it is recommended 
that you leave them they way they are set. 
It is not recommended to use the Advanced Search.  While you can click it, the options are 
unnecessary and confusing.
