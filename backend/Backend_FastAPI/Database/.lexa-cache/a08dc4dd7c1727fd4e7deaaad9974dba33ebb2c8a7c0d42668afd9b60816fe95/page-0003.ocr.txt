Step 11
Hanging from the ﬁ re bowl you’ll ﬁ nd two black wires.  Attach both 
of them to the black box on the control panel. (Note: there is no 
polarity issue, either wire can be connected to either plug)
Step 12
Replace the magnetic door and spread all of the glass stones evenly 
in the bowl over the burner area being careful to not hit or bend the 
ignitor. Keep glass clear of the spark to avoid blockage.
Step 13
If you purchased a glass wind guard, assemble that (directions on 
page 4) and put into place.
Step 14
Go to the front of your control panel. Unscrew the ignitor knob 
counter-clockwise and insert a AAA battery (positive facing out).  
Replace the ignitor button.
Step 13
Your ﬁ re pit is complete!
To Start
Open the magnetic ﬁ re pit door and turn the propane tank on and 
replace the door.  On the front control, turn the knob from “OFF” to 
“ON” and press the ignitor button.
NOTES:
• 
Do not burn your ﬁ re without the glass stones!
• 
Glass stones may split during/after use, this is normal due to the 
physical properties of glass.
• 
Cleaning: Use glass cleaner on the glass wind guard. For the 
MGP table top and base clean everyday dirt and stains with a 
soft sponge and mixture of mild detergent and water. Be weary 
of nylon scrubbies or stiff nylon brushes as excess force can mar 
the ﬁ nish.  Stains and marks have been successfully removed 
with the following branded products: Goof Off®, Mr. Clean Magic 
Eraser®, GOJO Orange Pumice Hand Cleaner and Simple Green.
Test Your Gas Lines
We recommend testing your gas lines before using to test for leaks. 
This can be done using the “Soapy Water Method”
1. 
Apply a soap-and-water solution to each connection in the gas 
lines and down the rubber hose.
2. 
Turn on the gas and look for bubbles.
3. 
If bubbles form, tighten the ﬁ tting slightly with a pipe wrench and 
recheck.
4. 
Be sure to wipe off the old solution and apply a new round of the 
soapy mixture.
5. 
If you see bubbles coming from the rubber hose line (not the 
ﬁ tting) turn the gas off and call for a replacement rubber hose.
