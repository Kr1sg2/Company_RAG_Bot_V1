Rattan Wiki 
The first use of rattan as a raw material for furniture would be difficult to set, but it is reasonable to 
assume it began with the natives of the Asian countries where the vine grows so profusely.  The wide 
variety of species, the pliable nature of the wood, its toughness, and its workability provided early artisans 
with raw materials for a wide variety of uses, including furniture. 
Rattan is not an ordinary material – 
far from it.  It has been called 
exotic, and indeed it is, for it has 
qualities that cannot be imitated 
by any other material.  It appears 
to be a vine but, in reality, is a palm.  
It has a great variety in natural 
form yet an inherent consistency of 
essential characteristics.  It is 
flexible but extremely tough.  It can 
be formed into intricate shapes 
without loss of its exceptional 
strength.  Its products are enjoyed in the most modern and sophisticated 
homes, yet its origins go back to primitive times, and it can be made into the 
most beautiful and distinctive furniture. 
 
The production of rattan into home furnishings starts its long journey to the living rooms of the world as 
a sprout deep in Southeast Asia's tropical rain forests, where it grows profusely in moist, swampy areas.  
There are a number of different species with a mature stem diameter ranging from 1/8 – inch to more 
than 2 – inches and with lengths from a few feet to several hundreds of feet.  As forests are destroyed, 
rattan production has begun to shift to plantations.  There are approximately 852 square miles of rattan 
plantations in Asian countries.  In Indonesia approximately 4,200 households engage in rattan harvesting 
and production, spread across South Kalimantan, Cirebon, and Central Sulawesi.  In the Philippines more 
than 4,000 workers engage in the production of rattan 
furniture and handicraft.  Income received from 
weaving rattan is 75% higher than income received 
from farming.
