Growing Characteristics 
The new rattan sprout starts life growing upward like a small palm; however, as it 
increases in size the weight of the fronds become too great for the stem to support 
and the stem bends causing the growth direction toward the ground.  Growth will 
continue along the ground until a bush or tree is met where it will grow upward, 
seeking sunlight, until it gets to the top where lack of support forces it to return to 
the ground where it will start the process all over again.  The vine clings tenaciously 
to the trees by means of grapples or thorny projections of the leaf stems, which grow 
from nodes on the main stem.  Rattan trees can reach lengths as long as 600 feet with 
growth paths through every part of the jungle. 
Harvesting 
Removing the vines from their paths of growth is very difficult.  The numerous thorns hold stubbornly to 
everything they touch and make grasping the stem by hand dangerous.  The large thorns on the nodes of 
the rattan tree could easily impale a hand.  Even with the inherent danger, the collection process must 
still be done by hand because the jungle terrain will not permit the use of mechanical equipment.  Rattan 
is harvested when it is 7 to 10 years old.  As vines are removed, they are cut into 18 to 20-foot lengths 
depending on stem diameter; the stems are stripped of thorns then washed and dried in open sunlight.  
Next, they are tied in bundles of approximately fifty 
poles, which is about all the average worker can manage.
