Cleaning and Care 
Care - Preventative Maintenance 
Rattan, wicker, and natural wood products are easy to care for.  For preventative maintenance, 
regular cleaning, dusting, and protecting, you may use normal household wood products, such 
as Old English, Murphy’s Oil Soap® or Pledge®. 
Precautions 
Rattan and wicker are very durable, and we do our best to build our product to exceed 
expectations.  A few simple precautions will go a long way in protecting your investment. 
Water and burn rings 
Leaving a cold or hot drink on a natural wood surface for a prolonged period can cause a ring.  
When placing a drink on a wood surface, always use a coaster, napkin, or some other brier to 
absorb moisture or insulate from the heat. 
Scratches and abrasions 
Scratches and abrasions happen when items impact or slide on a surface, especially if the 
surface is not cleaned and dusted regularly.  Always place items onto a wood surface 
thoughtfully, and when available, use items such as placemats and pot holders to protect the 
surface.

A spill can happen quickly, and when it does, time is of the essence. General dirt and dust can 
accumulate as part of normal use.

harder it will be to 
clean
