2021 Palm Springs Rattan Ownership Packet 
12/31/2021 
 
Introduction 
Since 1971, we have been designing and manufacturing comfortable, stylish furniture and 
accessories made to last. Because of our policy of only using high-quality materials, your Palm 
Springs Rattan® furniture will last and be easy to own. 
The Difference 
Handcrafted 
Each piece of Palm Springs Rattan® furniture is handcrafted one at a time.  Every element is 
individually crafted and fitted to each piece.  Handwoven wicker, artisan carved wood additions, 
and leather-bound joints add embellishments to each item, making it a unique statement in 
your home. 
Hardware & Construction 
We build the products the same way whether they go into your home or a hotel.  You can trust 
that you get the best quality every time.  A skilled craftsman screws each piece together to 
ensure unrivaled longevity.  Joints are glued to prevent squeaking, and every trim element is 
secured in place.   The leather bindings are secured to the frame by an adhesive on every 
contact surface. 
Material 
We visit our manufacturing partners annually to ensure that only “A” grade, sustainable 
material is used in each piece. 
Rattan 
A member of the palm family, rattan is a palm tree that grows like a vine up to 600 feet long in 
the jungles of the Far East.  Cut when it is seven to ten years old, the vine quickly replenishes itself. 
To read more about rattan, please refer to page 16, at the end of this ownership packet. 
Wicker 
Wicker is not a material, but a description that means to weave material.  Wicker can be any 
pliable material. 
Safety 
We, at Leaders, take safety very seriously.  In our continuing effort to ensure that 
the experience with your new purchase is positive with regard to comfort, quality 
and design.  Please note the following important safety information, in addition to 
any other safety information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of 
damaged furniture can result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if unaddressed can 
become major repair and service issues that can create potential safety issues.
