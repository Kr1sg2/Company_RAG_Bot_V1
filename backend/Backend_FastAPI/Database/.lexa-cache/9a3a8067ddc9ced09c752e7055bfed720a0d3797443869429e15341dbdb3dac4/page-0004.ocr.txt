Mileage 
Mileage reimbursement is only eligible to team members who are traveling from outside of Pinellas County.  Mileage is 
calculated by the accounts payable department and is the shortest route between two points per routing software.  The 
rate per mile will be calculated by dividing the average cost per gallon of unleaded in Florida by 20 miles per gallon then 
adding .05¢ per mile for repair and maintenance. 
Example: $3.50 \ 20mpg =.17¢ per mile  
.17¢ per mile + .05¢ = .22¢ reimbursed per mile
