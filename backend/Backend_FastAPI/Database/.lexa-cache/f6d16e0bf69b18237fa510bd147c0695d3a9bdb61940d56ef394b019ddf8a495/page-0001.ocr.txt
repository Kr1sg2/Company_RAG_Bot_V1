Inventory Control Form 
(ICF) 
The **Inventory Control Form (ICF) is used to: 
 Identify product missing a serial number tag 
 Identify an issue or problem with a product 
 Identify merchandise returning to the warehouse that has an issue or problem 
 
The ICF form must be completely filled out every time one is used and attached to a product.  If 
a serial number or SKU tag falls off of a product, it needs to be able to be identified by the 
information you provide on the Inventory Control Form. BE SPECIFIC IN YOUR DESCRIPTION OF 
WHAT IS WRONG.
