Pilling Fabric 
 
What causes pilling? 
Pilling is caused when loose fibers move to the surface of the fabric, where they are subject to 
friction, which causes them to twist together into small balls or pills. These fibers will also 
become intertwined with the fibers that are woven into the fabric, so that the pill is secured to 
the surface of the material. 
The friction that causes pilling is from normal use and will be present during the course of 
people using the furniture and rubbing against the surface of the fabric.  Laundering can also 
cause this friction – washing machines agitate fabric, causing the surfaces to rub together. 
Pilling is more noticeable on man-made fibers. This is mainly because natural fabrics shed loose 
fibers easily and less noticeably, while man-made fibers are notoriously strong, so the pills are 
anchored strongly to the fabric. 
It is important to note that pilling is NOT a fabric defect or fault and it is NOT covered under 
warranty.  It can be compared to shedding experienced when purchasing new carpet – think 
about the way the carpet behaves when newly installed, as there are constantly new loose 
fibers coming to the surface over a period of time and use. This is completely normal and will 
reduce once the excess fibers are gone. 
Consumers are sometimes are concerned that pilling means that the fabric is wearing away and 
disintegrating but this is not the case. Pilling is a normal occurrence caused by wear and tear, 
does not affect the durability or functionality of the fabric, and is easily removable. 
Some fabrics pill more than others as some are coated/ treated during the manufacturing 
process to adhere to excess fibers coming to the surface of the fabric. Some fabrics are put 
through a process called singeing which quickly burns the excess surface fibers away. 
Smooth, tightly woven fabrics and fabric made from tightly twisted yarns, are less likely to pill 
as these fibers are held tightly in the cloth. When a fabric is made of more than one fiber type, 
or one is stronger than the other (example poly-cotton), pilling will be more noticeable. The 
weaker fiber wears and breaks while the stronger fiber holds the pill to the cloth. 
Solution 
Pilling is common, so common that there are a number of very inexpensive but effective fabric 
pill removers on the market.  They can be purchased online, Walmart, Target, or most craft 
stores for under $20.
