Team Expectations 
Open 
At least one team member must show up 30 minutes before the scheduled public opening to review the  
interior and exterior of the showroom for safety and to ensure that the showroom is recovered: systems  
are online, logged in, and prepared to create the best customer experience. 
Close 
All Leader’s Casual Furniture® showrooms must have at least (2) team members scheduled to work from  
11am to close.  This ensures a team atmosphere with the safest physical environment for associates and  
guests.  Having two team members working together through close allows for a team effort to prevent  
injury, allows the team members to look out for one another, and will ensure the best customer  
experience. 
Break 
Retail is an exciting career full of potential and reward.  A day can go from slow to busy in minutes.  It is  
Leader’s hope that each team member can get up to 30 minutes of personal time in a day.  It is realized  
because of the variability of retail traffic that this 30 minutes will not be at a regular scheduled time and  
that it will be taken at the best opportunity that does not affect the guest experience.
