Change Location an Item is Committed From 
 
Occasionally it may be necessary to change the location an item is committed to.  For example, an item could be missing 
even though the computer shows stock, or it was discovered the item was damaged. 
 
The default reservation location is the Distribution Center.  Rarely will your orders for furniture have to link to 
showroom floors.  This happens when the items are closeout, accessory items, or we have low stock.
