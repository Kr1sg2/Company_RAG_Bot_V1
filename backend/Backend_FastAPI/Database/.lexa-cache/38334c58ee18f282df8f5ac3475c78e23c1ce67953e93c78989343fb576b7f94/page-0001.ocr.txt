• When adjusting the umbrella, make sure that no person(s) or item(s) are close to the umbrella. This is important to prevent injury or
material damage. 
• Always close the umbrella during windy conditions or in rain. Never allow the umbrella to flap in the wind; this could damage the
canopy. If damage occurs, this is not covered by the warranty.
• Do not leave open umbrella unattended. If damage occurs, this is not covered by the warranty.
• Properly store umbrella when not in use. Close umbrella, properly fold canopy, tie string around canopy and cover umbrella with pro-
vided protective cover. 
• For Starlux style, do not operate the power switch or attempt to charge the umbrella in inclement weather (rain, snow) so as to prevent
damage to the electrical components. When lights are not in use, unplug power supply from umbrella and put the cap back onto the
plug to protect the electrical components inside.

The canopy will last longer if you fold it as it was packed and shipped.  This technique is similar to the way a parachute is folded and is es-
pecially important when folding the canopy for seasonal storage or when left in the closed position for an extended period of time.  
Using this technique at all times will significantly extend the life of the canopy.
• When the canopy has been fully lowered, stand in front of the canopy structure and begin the folding process by
pulling out two panels opposite the mast. Pull the two panels together and roll tight into the canopy.
• Once rolled tight, pull adjacent panels out one at a time and fold to the center, alternating sides until all the panels
have been pulled out from the arms and folded into the center.
• Tie string around canopy and cover umbrella with provided protective cover.

Cleaning:
• Prolong the life of the umbrella and canopy with regular cleaning (at least once a month).
Cleaning Canopy:
• Use TG Care Upholstery & Fabric Cleaner and TG Care Scrubbing Pad to remove dirt and restore the new look of the canopy. 
• If mold or mildew is present, use TG Care Mold & Mildew Stain Remover to quickly dissolve stains.
• After cleaning, we recommend to treat furniture fabric with TG Care Fabric &I Upholstery Protector using the Application Cloths before
outdoor exposure. It will help prevent stains and allow the canopy repellent to dirt, water and moisture. 
• Allow a wet canopy to dry slightly opened, but do not leave unattended.
Cleaning Umbrella:
• Wipe sliding marks on the aluminum poles with TG Care Stainless Steel & Cast Aluminum Cleaner & Guard using the Application Cloths
to clean and protect in one simple treatment.
• If any scratches are visible, touch up aluminum frame using TG Care Touch Up Paint. Allow paint to fully dry before using umbrella.
When not in use:
• Close, tie and cover umbrella with a protective cover. 
• For Starlux style, store power cord/transformer in dry place.
Winter Storage:
• Safely remove from base or mount and store in a dry place.
After the Winter:
• Check the condition and function of the umbrella. Any defects must be repaired by a professional.
