The Difference 
Frames 
All Tropitone® extruded aluminum furniture frames feature a welded, all aluminum 
frame construction and uses full circumference welding in all load-bearing joints since it 
is the strongest way to join two pieces of aluminum.  Some collections may feature 
frames that are either solid cast aluminum or a combination of cast and extruded 
aluminum. Cast to extruded material connections have a deep penetrating weld design 
to insure superior strength. 
 
Finishes 
Pre-wash/Pre-finish 
o All Tropitone® casual furniture is prepared for our powder coated finish in a multi-step wash process 
which both cleans the frame and also applies a special finish-bonding agent. This ensures that the 
powder coating will adhere uniformly. 
o 
powder coating 
o 
Tropitone® durable polyurethane or polyurethane/polyester blend powder coating is 
significantly thicker than paint. It is applied electrostatically as a powder and then baked at 
temperatures exceeding 400° F.  This causes the powder to melt and flow evenly all around the 
frame. 
 
Fabric and Fills 
Tropitone outdoor cushions are constructed of fabrics containing UV and mildew inhibitors. 
Additionally, each cushion is constructed of a mildew resistant core of self-draining fills, which is then wrapped 
in a water resistant covering. All Tropitone® fabrics, fill and foam are flame retardant, meeting fire code rating 
CA117. 
Safety  
In our continuing effort to ensure that your experience with your new purchase is positive with regard to comfort, quality and 
design, we take safety very seriously.  Please note the following important safety information, in addition to any other safety 
information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of damaged furniture can result in injury.  Minor repair 
issues, if unaddressed, can become major repair and service issues that can create potential safety issues.  Contact the Leader 
Furniture® Solutions Center for support at solutions.center@leadersfurniture.com  
Product Inspection 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Inspections must include, but not be limited 
to, joint tightness, spring assemblies, and the weld areas of the product’s, arms and legs.  If joints are loose or any cracks should 
appear on the product or at welds, the item must immediately be removed from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing hardware be detected, the item must be removed from 
service immediately until the hardware can be properly tightened and/or replaced.  
Inspections must include chaise lounge and recliner headrest ratchets.  Periodically tighten the headrest bolts on all chaise lounges 
and recliners.  Confirm all other hardware is tight, movement is smooth without binding, and that the ratchet engages 
properly at each position.  At the same time, carefully inspect the headrest ratchets for breakage and/or wear. If 
headrest ratchet breakage and/or indications of headrest ratchet wear are present, a replacement headrest should be 
ordered.  The furniture must immediately be removed from service until repaired and/or replacement parts installed. 
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS AND ACCESSORIES section of this brochure. 
Product failure caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and maintenance is not covered by the product 
warranty.
