Introduction 
The Tropitone® brand was originally established as a commercial brand in 1954 by Mr. Burt M. Baker, a retired Lockheed 
Aircraft engineer and executive at Grand Rapids Chair Co.  Upon moving to Florida, he established the Tropitone brand, 
crafting furniture for hotels, clubs and resorts. At this time, car travel was starting to boom in the USA.  As travelers 
became familiar with the Tropitone® brand products at hotels and resorts, they began asking where they could buy such 
comfortable, stylish, high quality products for their homes. Tropitone decided to fill that demand by offering 
commercial-quality products for sale at retail. 
In the 1960s they introduced powder coated aluminum finishes to the industry. Utilizing a multi-step wash process that 
ensures a lasting finish, Tropitone’s aluminum frames last longer under any environmental conditions.  Tropitone also 
pioneered the technique of double-wrapping vinyl straps around the powder coated aluminum frame for extra 
durability. 
The Tropitone® Furniture Co., Inc. established their operations in Irvine, California in 1970, to serve the ever-growing 
demand for outdoor patio furniture in the western USA. This western base houses a full-service manufacturing facility 
and eventually became the corporate headquarters. This move provided a bi-coastal manufacturing advantage and close 
proximity to North American customers that is crucial to respond quickly to ever-changing marketplace conditions. 
Throughout the years following, Tropitone has continued to change the standards for an entire industry by applying the 
rigorous product and service requirements of the highly demanding commercial market to the residential market. They 
have broad and deep portfolio of products specifically designed for commercial and residential outdoor spaces, all with 
the same standards of comfort and excellence.
