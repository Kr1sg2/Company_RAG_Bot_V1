*All warranties are from the original first delivery to the original purchaser.  Warranted time frames do not start over for any 
subsequent delivery of product replaced for any reason.  Warranties only cover the original purchaser and are void upon ownership 
transfer.   
**Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of these mills and the mill finds 
the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make the new covers for your cushions.  If you would like completely 
new cushions made, you may choose to pay for new foam cores while the covers are being remade. Dye lot variation results in color 
differences from bolt to bolt and may not match your fabric swatch or previous shipments.
