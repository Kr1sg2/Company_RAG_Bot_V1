FIRE MEDIA INSTALLATION 
 
 
Please follow the instructions below to add the finishing touch to your Fire Pit. Your Fire Pit needs fire 
media in order to get the proper flame characteristics from the burner assembly.  The media can 
be decorative fire glass, fire pebbles, lava rock or other fire media specifically designed for outdoor 
fire pits and fireplaces. Fire media is not included with Fire Pit and must be purchased 
separately. 
 
              DANGER Do not block the pilot area or blow out box. The burner may be lightly covered by fire 
media. Proper air flow is required in order to prevent suffocation and possible gas buildup. Incorrect 
media installation will cause the pilot flame to suffocate and turn off the fire pit or delay main burner 
ignition. If the main burner does not ignite quickly, gas can build up in the burner tray and ignite 
violently. Ignition of gas which has built up can create an unsafe condition, and may cause 
injury or death, and may damage personal property. The deeper your decorative glass, fire 
pebbles or lava rock, the more risk of reducing or smothering the flame from the burner. 
 
Decorative Glass or Fire Pebbles Application 
 
1) Install your Fire Pit per instructions. 
 
2) Apply decorative glass or fire pebbles just 
deep enough to cover bottom of pan. Make sure 
you do NOT cover the Blow Out Box.

3) Blow Out Box: Do not cover blow out box vents 
or opening with decorative glass or fire pebbles. 
Incorrect media installation will cause the pilot 
flame to suffocate and turn off pit or delay main 
burner ignition. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DO NOT COVER VENTS! DO NOT COVER PILOT 
OPENING! 
 
 
Lava Rock Only Application* 
 
1) Install your Fire Pit per instructions. 
 
2) Apply lava rock ONLY deep enough to cover 
ring and pan- no more than ½” above the burner. 
 
 
 
3) Blow Out Box: Do not cover vents with lava 
rock- leave open. Do not allow any rock to block 
flame opening.
