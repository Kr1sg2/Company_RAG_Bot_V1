FIRE PIT NATURAL GAS CONVERSION AND OPERATING 
INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 
 
First turn the LP Gas tank (if installed) fully off by rotating the valve completely to the left until 
closed. Then disconnect the LP Gas tank hose with built in regulator by turning the large connector 
fully counter-clockwise until the hose is completely disconnected. 
 
The proper pressure and gas type must be checked prior to installation.  A 1/8” NPT test port is 
provided at the burner assembly connection beneath the burner tray.  When converting from LP 
to Natural gas, installer must remove the supplied gas hose and LP regulator and install the 
correct regulator for Natural gas. The regulator must limit the supply as specified below: 
 
Natural Gas: 
 
Supply Pressure: 
 
Minimum 5.0” WC (water column), Maximum 10.0” WC 
 
 
Operating Pressure: 
 
Minimum 5.0” WC, Maximum 7.0” WC 
 
 
 
Remove the LP Gas tank hose from the gas valve at the elbow (or straight connector) coming out 
of the gas valve as shown above.  Connect your inlet supply line, including pressure regulator to 
this location.  Follow all local codes.  Do not install without a regulator, which will limit your fuel 
supply to 5 inches of water column.
