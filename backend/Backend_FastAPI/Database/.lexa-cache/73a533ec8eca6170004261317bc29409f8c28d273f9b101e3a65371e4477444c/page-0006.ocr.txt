Cleaning and Care 
Leaders Furniture™ takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to clean does 
not mean that it will not get dirty in an indoor environment.  Regular periodic care of your indoor 
furniture will help maintain its appearance and functionality better than occasional, heavy-duty 
maintenance.  A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping your new furnishings 
looking new, longer. 
Pilling 
Fabric pilling happens when loose fibers move to the fabric's surface, where they are subject to 
friction, which causes them to twist together into small balls or pills. These fibers will also 
become intertwined with the fibers that are woven into the fabric, so that the pill is secured to 
the surface of the material.  The friction that causes pilling is from normal use and will be 
present during the course of people using the furniture and rubbing against the surface of the 
fabric.  It is important to note that pilling is NOT a fabric defect or fault and it is NOT covered 
under warranty. It can be compared to shedding experienced when purchasing new carpet – 
think about the way the carpet behaves when newly installed, as there are constantly new loose 
fibers coming to the surface over a period of time and use. This is completely normal and will 
reduce once the excess fibers are gone.   
Pilling is more likely to occur on a softer fabric with multiple fiber types and less likely to occur 
on a tightly woven fabric or ones made from tightly twisted yarns.  As it is such a common 
occurrence, there are several very inexpensive but effective fabric pill removers on the market.  
They can be purchased online, Walmart, Target, or most craft stores for under $20.
