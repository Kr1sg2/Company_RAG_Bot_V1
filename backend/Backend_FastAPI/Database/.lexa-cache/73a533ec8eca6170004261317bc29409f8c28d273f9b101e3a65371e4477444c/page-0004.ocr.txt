The Difference 
Frame 
We build frames from solid hardwood, reinforced with double boarding and bracing in critical 
areas.  The frames are insulated and padded with a dense polyurethane foam, for long-lasting 
comfort.  
Springs 
All pieces have a tempered, heavy-gauge spring construction for durability with insulated spring 
clips to prevent squeaking.  A heavy fiber pad insulation installed over the springs provides 
padding and weight distribution. 
Cushions 
Seat cushions are made with a durable foam core, wrapped with polyester fiber.  Back cushions 
are filled with a polyester fiber in a compartmentalized inner casing to prevent shifting and 
sagging.
