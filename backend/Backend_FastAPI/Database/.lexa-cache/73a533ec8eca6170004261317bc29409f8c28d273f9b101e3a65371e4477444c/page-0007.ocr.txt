Cushion Cleaning 
Supplies needed: 
• 
Cleaning solvent                                                  
• 
White paper towels or clean white rag 
• 
Hairdryer (optional but suggested) 
For spot cleaning, use a mild, pure solvent (such as Carbona® or Simple Green®) and work in a 
well-ventilated room. Avoid any product containing carbon tetrachloride, as it is highly toxic.  
Always pre-test cleaning agents on a hidden area. Wait until the fabric dries to confirm that 
fabric is colorfast before proceeding.  Solvents must be used appropriately or there may be a 
"clean spot" or a noticeable ring left on the fabric. 
 
Before beginning, assemble the required supplies (listed above).  Place cotton cloth/paper 
towels beneath the stain (if possible).  Apply cleaning solvent to another towel or rag, do not 
apply solvent directly to cushion.  Promptly daub onto the stain, do not rub as this may cause 
the fabric to show wear more quickly.  Dry immediately with the hairdryer to reduce the chance 
of the dyes running or leaving a “clean spot” (suggested).  This process may need to be repeated 
in order to remove stain completely. 
 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE 
THE SEAMS OF THE CASE. 
 
NOTE:  If, and only if, your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may 
use 1-part bleach mixed with 1-part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions. Check a small 
inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion. Be sure to rinse the cushion 
thoroughly to remove all the bleach solution.
