Introduction 
When it comes to our fully upholstered collections, Leader’s has always set out to produce the highest 
quality product, but also provide a wide variety of customization to our customers.  With our “Designed 
By You” line, we can do just that.  By controlling the shape, depth, firmness and fabric of your furniture 
you can create thousands of combinations, perfect for your unique sense of style and in home space.  
However, even though we use only the highest quality American craftsmanship and materials, providing 
periodic care will help to maintain the beauty and longevity of your furniture for years to come. 
 
The Difference 
Frame 
All frames are made of solid hardwood, reinforced with double boarding and bracing in critical 
areas and are assembled.  The frames are insulated and padded with a dense polyurethane 
foam, for long-lasting comfort.  
Springs 
All pieces have a tempered, heavy gauge spring construction with insulated spring clips, for 
metal noise reduction.  This gives the comfort coil spring seating, with the durability of sinuous 
springs.  Heavy fiber pad insulation installed over the springs provides padding and weight 
distribution. 
 
Cushions 
Seat cushions are made with a 1.8lb foam core, wrapped with a polyester fiber.  The inside of 
the back cushions are insulated and padded for extra comfort.  They are filled with a polyester 
fiber wrapped in a compartmentalized inner casing to prevent shifting and sagging.
