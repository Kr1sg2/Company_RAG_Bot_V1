experience with your new purchase is positive with regard to comfort, quality and design, 
please note the following important safety information, in addition to any other safety 
information noted in this booklet. 
Safety Warning!  Use of furniture in need of care and maintenance or use of damaged 
furniture can result in injury.  Minor repair issues, if unaddressed can become major repair 
and service issues that can create potential safety issues.  Contact the Leader’s Casual Furniture®

Product Inspection 
Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage and/or indications of wear.  Inspections must 
include, but not be limited to, joint tightness, spring assemblies and the weld areas of the product’s, 
arms and legs.  If joints are loose or any cracks should appear on the product or at welds, the item must 
immediately be removed from service until repaired.  
Inspections must include all bolts and screws.  Should any loose or missing 
hardware be detected, the item must be removed from service immediately 
until the hardware can be properly tightened and/or replaced.  
To obtain replacement parts, please see the SERVICE / ORDERING PARTS AND

Product failure caused by a lack of reasonable and necessary care and 
maintenance is not covered by the product warranty. 
Notice for Contract Installations:  Periodically and carefully inspect all products for breakage 
and/or indications of wear.  Such inspections must include all products of a like kind and model, 
not merely a random sampling within model categories or among like products.

Cleaning and Care 
Leader’s Casual Furniture® takes pride in providing products that are easy to clean and own.  Easy to 
clean does not mean that it will not get dirty in an indoor environment.  A little preventative 
maintenance goes a long way in to keeping your new furnishings looking new, longer. 
 
Regular periodic care of your indoor furniture will help maintain its appearance and functionality better 
than occasional, heavy duty maintenance. Consider the specific conditions and usage to which your 
product is exposed, so appropriate maintenance can be planned.
