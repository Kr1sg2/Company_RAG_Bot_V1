Pilling 
Fabric pilling is caused when loose fibers move to the surface of the fabric, where they are 
subject to friction, which causes them to twist together into small balls or pills. These fibers will 
also become intertwined with the fibers that are woven into the fabric, so that the pill is secured 
to the surface of the material.  The friction that causes pilling is from normal use and will be 
present during the course of people using the furniture and rubbing against the surface of the 
fabric.  It is important to note that pilling is NOT a fabric defect or fault and it is NOT covered 
under warranty. It can be compared to shedding experienced when purchasing new carpet – 
think about the way the carpet behaves when newly installed, as there are constantly new loose 
fibers coming to the surface over a period of time and use. This is completely normal and will 
reduce once the excess fibers are gone.   
Pilling is more likely to occur on a softer fabric with multiple fiber types and less likely to occur 
on a tightly woven fabric or ones made from tightly twisted yarns.  As it is such a common 
occurrence, there are a number of very inexpensive but effective fabric pill removers on the 
market.  They can be purchased online, Walmart, Target, or most craft stores for under $20. 
 
Cushion Cleaning 
Supplies needed: 
 
Cleaning solvent                                                  
 
White paper towels or clean white rag 
 
Hairdryer (optional but suggested) 
For spot cleaning, use a mild pure solvent (such as Carbona® or Simple Green®) and work in a 
well-ventilated room. Avoid any product containing carbon tetrachloride, as it is highly toxic.  
Always pre-test cleaning agents on a hidden area. Wait until the fabric dries to confirm that 
fabric is colorfast prior proceeding.  Solvents must be properly used or there may be a "clean 
spot" or a noticeable ring left on the fabric. 
 
Before beginning, assemble required supplies (listed above). Place cotton cloth/paper towels 
beneath the stain (if possible). Apply cleaning solvent to another towel or rag (do not apply 
solvent directly to cushion). Promptly daub onto the stain, do not rub as this may cause the 
fabric to show wear more quickly.  Dry immediately with the hairdryer to reduce the chance of 
the dyes running or leaving a “clean spot” (suggested).  This process may need to be repeated in 
order to remove stain completely. 
 
DO NOT MACHINE WASH OR MACHINE DRY THE CUSHION CASINGS.  YOU COULD DAMAGE 
THE SEAMS OF THE CASE. 
 
***If, and only if, your cushion is made from 100% solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella®, you may 
use 1 part bleach mixed with 1 part water and mild dish soap to clean your cushions. Check a small 
inconspicuous spot for color fastness before cleaning the entire cushion. Be sure to rinse the cushion 
thoroughly to remove all of the bleach solution.***
