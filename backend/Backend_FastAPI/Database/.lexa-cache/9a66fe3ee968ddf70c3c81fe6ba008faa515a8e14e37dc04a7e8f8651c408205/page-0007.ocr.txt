*Some fabric mills warranty their fabric for 5 years.  If your cushions are made by fabric from one of 
these mills and the mill finds the fabric to be defective, the mill will supply us with fabric to make the 
new covers for your cushions.  If you would like complete new cushions made, you may choose to pay 
for new foam cores while the covers are being remade. Dye lot variation results in color differences 
from bolt to bolt and may not match your fabric swatch or previous shipments. 
No Commercial Warranties Apply
