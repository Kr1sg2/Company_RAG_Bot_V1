Premium Delivery  
• 
Residential Delivery only and not an available option for Commercial, Designer or Shipping. 
• 
To Charge for Premium.  Select Leaders Delivery Truck as you Delivery Method.  This will charge 
for Standard Delivery and to make Premium you must enter “LEAD-PREMIUM DELIVERY” as a 
line item on the Sales Order. 
When a customer selects in-home delivery and wants to pick up items in the store, you can write more 
than one Sales Order or decrease your transaction time by writing one Sales Order and following the 
steps below. 
The only exception to this policy is if Leaders or a supplier makes a mistake and we are attempting to 
improve a guests experience.  An extended ETA on special order items is not covered by this exception.  
Please contact the Sale Leadership team for approval.
