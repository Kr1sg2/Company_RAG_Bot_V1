 Is the re-sale certificate good forever? 
o No, the certificate is good for 1 calendar year. Leader’s Casual Furniture® will need the 
current certificate each year.  
 If a designer is from out of state can we extend the designer discount to them? 
o Yes, but they cannot use their re-sale certificate.  We can only accept re-sale certificates 
from the state of Florida. 
 When a designer purchases product for their client, is it entered into FROG any differently than 
a normal sale? 
o The customer account info will be the designer. The “deliver to” address is the client of 
the designer.  
 Is there a discount multiplier on designer sales like we use on Contract sales? 
o Yes, there is a multiplier to use to calculate the discount, depending on the vendor; 
however it is not based on how many pieces purchased like with contract. 
o Discount is calculated on “The Everyday Low” prices, never on “Group Prices” 
 Are we able to extend the discount to a designer or decorator even if they are purchasing for 
themselves and not a client? 
o Yes, although if they are usually tax exempt this would NOT be a tax exempt sale 
 Is there a “LEAD” line entered into FROG on these types of sales?
