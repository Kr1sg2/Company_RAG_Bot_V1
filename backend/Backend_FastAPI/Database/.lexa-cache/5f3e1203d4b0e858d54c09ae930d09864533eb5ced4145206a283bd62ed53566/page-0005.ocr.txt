Preventing mistakes before they happen 
o We have a 1st time delivery completion percentage of around 90%. So what happens on 
the other 10%? 8 out of 10 times it is due to errors made at the store level.  
o Store errors that cause delivery non-completion is now being tracked and part of the 
manager bonus. There is a simple and quick way to prevent the majority of errors made 
and that is to review each invoice with the customer. Make this part of your sales 
process and review the following items with the customer before they leave the store: 
 
The frame, fabric, or sling color selected 
 
The correct quantity of each piece 
 
Make sure every piece the customer wanted to purchase is on the invoice 
 
Review the price of the items 
 
Make sure the sales tax is calculated correctly 
 
Make sure the correct lead time is written down and have the customer sign off on 
it.  Manage their expectations from the beginning. 
o Take an extra minute or two to do this, and you can prevent most mistakes before they 
happen. The customer will appreciate the extra attention to detail, it will enhance their 
shopping experience at Leaders, and our 1st time delivery completion will climb higher 
and higher. 
Sale Types, and who delivery updates the orders.  
o Typically once an order has been delivered to, picked up by the customer, we receive 
confirmation of shipment from the vendor, or it is picked up by the 3rd party shipper, 
the order is delivery updated.  In the event that a sales type 1, 3, or 4 has not been 
delivery updated, below is a list of who is able to update each type of invoice. Please e-
mail a request to the correct department in order to have the invoice updated.
