Reading and understanding the customer look-up window: 
o The customer look-up window shows all of the customer’s invoices and money 
movement. Understanding how it works is essential in managing customer accounts. 
We have a procedure that covers this in-depth.  
o Level 1 training dives into the “Customer Look-up” function in FROG and helps give an 
in-depth understanding of this feature: R:\Training\2.0 Level 1 Itinerary\Level 1 Week 
1\3. Wednesday\2 Customer Look-Up.pdf 
o Additionally, the review on this topic provides a nice self-test to check your 
understanding of this feature: R:\Training\2.0 Level 1 Itinerary\Level 1 Week 1\3.

o Below is a typical customer account. We see on line 1, invoice 1817486 has a portion 
back-ordered off, which creates invoice B18174861 on line 3. 
 
The original deposit for invoice 1817486 was $1119.00. Payment was a “BC” and 
that is under the column for code 
 
Once the back-order is created, money will be transferred from the original 
invoice, to the back-ordered invoice. We see that on sales order #1 where 
directly underneath the deposit, the red arrow points out the back-order, 
B18174861, with the code “BO” and it moves $332.10 to line 3.
