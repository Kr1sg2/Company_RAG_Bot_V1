 
Customer has a special order, so a 25% deposit is required, and the balance 
is being financed by the customer. Here is how the money portion should 
look when entered correctly in FROG:  
 25% deposit amount is entered, in this case it is 696.17. 
 Balance is for the remaining amount that will be financed. The 
deposit and balance equal the total amount of the sale 
 Deposit taken is entered, in this case it was a “BC”. The deposit can 
NEVER be “FI”, only “BC”, “CS”, or “CK”. 
 Method of payment is entered always as “FI”. It is NEVER “CBD” on 
Wells Fargo orders, or else the customer will not be charged for 
their order! 
 FI amount is entered, in this case it is the balance of 2088.52
