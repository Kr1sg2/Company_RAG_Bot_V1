Managing Open Orders 
 
o In order for customer invoices to be kept up to date, and have orders that are ready to 
deliver scheduled, we have the display backlog open when you clock in to work. 
However, you can manage your open orders at any time, and there are a few ways to do 
this. 
 
Check the AIR report 
 
FROG\Purchasing\Reports\Against Incoming\Enter Date 
 
Go into the Open Sales Report 
 
FROG\Sales\Reports\Open Sales Reports\Salesman 
 
Go into the Display Backlog on your own: 
 
FROG\Sales\Follow\Display Backlog\Salesman 
o Updating your customer ETAs. 
 
We frequently have customers that are not 
ready for delivery for a variety of reasons, and 
the furniture is being held in the warehouse. 
We need to move the ETAs in FROG on these 
invoices.  
 
We also need to utilize the second memo box 
to note an estimated date of when the customer will be ready for delivery. Any 
communication with the customer should be put here with the date of contact 
along with your sales ID number and initials. This way, anyone that is reviewing 
open orders knows what is happening with the customer’s account.
