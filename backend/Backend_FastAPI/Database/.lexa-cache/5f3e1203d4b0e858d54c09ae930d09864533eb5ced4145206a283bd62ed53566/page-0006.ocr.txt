Fixing Balancing Issues: 
o One of the most common daily tasks we all encounter is fixing balancing issues in FROG. 
Our 2.2 Closing Procedure goes into detail in each aspect of the daily closing procedure, 
and it has a section focusing on fixing balancing issues: R:\Procedure Manual\2.0 
General Store Procedure\2.2 Closing Procedure.pdf

Negative difference in bank card 
 
Positive difference in bank card 
o 2 of the most common mistakes made that creates Open Balance issues: 
 
When creating either a Credit Memo or doing a cancel/rewrite when the money 
amount pops up, instead of entering “0” and entering the new invoice created, we 
hit enter instead, and skip over this. This will create one invoice having a negative 
balance, and another having a positive balance. This is corrected by utilizing the 
“Move Money” e-mail template: R:\Email Templates\Store Email Templates\Move 
Money Request.msg 
 
In fact, this template is utilized any time money needs to be moved for an 
account. 
 
When creating a LEAD-EXCHANGE invoice, sometimes a credit memo is 
forgotten to be created to off-set the money owed on the exchange, and 
bring back the damage or incorrect items back into inventory. Simple 
solution: 
 Create the Credit Memo: R:\Procedure Manual\4.0 Customer 
Accounts_AR\4.11 Credit Memo.pdf 
 Delivery update the credit memo if it is a sale type 2. If it is a sale 
type 1, the delivery driver or warehouse group will delivery update 
the credit memo. 
o When entering a Wells Fargo order, if we do not enter the Method of Payment correctly 
as “FI”, the customer will not be charged for the order. That is because it will not 
prompt the accounts receivable department to charge the customer’s Wells Fargo 
account. There are only 2 options in entering a Wells Fargo order. 
 
Customer is financing the entire order, because it is all stock items. Here is 
how the money portion should look when entered correctly in FROG:  
 Deposit is entered as “0” 
 The balance will be for the full amount, in this case 1624.82, which 
equals the total amount of the sale. 
 The deposit is “ND” which will be automatically filled in when you 
enter in “0” as the deposit 
 Method of payment is entered always as “FI”. It is NEVER “CBD” on 
Wells Fargo orders, or else the customer will not be charged for 
their order! 
 The FI amount is entered, in this case it is for the total amount of 
the sale, 1624.82.
