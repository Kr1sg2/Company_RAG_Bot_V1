o This customer had an invoice re-written, which is invoice 1817501 on line 2 in order to 
correct the ticket. 
 
You can see the new invoice on line 2 is written, and the deposit is “ND” for no 
deposit.  
 
The back-ordered invoice on line 3, B188174861, is cancelled. The code “CN-
TRN”, cancel –transfer, illustrates this. The $332.10 that is attached to the 
cancelled invoice is now transferred to the new invoice, 1817501. The red 
arrows illustrate this money movement. 
 
  
 
o The customer pays for the balance on the two invoices, 1817486 on line 1 and 1817501 
on line 2 on 07-02-15. They pay by “BC”, which is entered into FROG by going into the 
customer’s account and going into AR options and selecting cash receipts. The red 
arrows illustrate the “BC” payments. The balances are paid in full, and the customer’s 
open balance is now zero. All orders have been either been delivery updated or 
cancelled, so they show as a sale type 9.
