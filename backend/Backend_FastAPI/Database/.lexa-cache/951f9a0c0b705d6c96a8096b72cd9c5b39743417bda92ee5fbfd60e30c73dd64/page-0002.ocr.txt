Finding the data 
Finding the prospect list is simple.  There are two reports available on the Navigation Shortcut Group on 
the home screen. 
 
Customer Sales History (2019 – Present) 
Customer Sales History searches all the guests who have purchased since we went live on NetSuite in 
2019.  Customer records will already exist for all the guests you find in this search.  Any communication 
sent out of NetSuite will automatically log in to the communications tab of the Customer Record.
