Company Overview:  Since 2004, we’ve focused on only three things: making the very best poly 
furniture, figuring out how to make it even better and providing customer service that no one can 
beat.  That’s the Lancaster County, PA way.  Our area has become world famous for doing things right, 
and we don’t plan to tarnish that reputation.  It’s a tall order that is not easy to live up to, but we 
haven’t back down from it yet.  Our poly furniture is meticulously crafted by expert artisans who are 
passionate about their work, and who never cut corners.  We’re constantly on the lookout for ways to 
improve.  One big way we do that is by listening to our customers.  How can we update our styling?  
What can we do to make our poly furniture even stronger, while also making it more beautiful?  Is 
there a way to increase the durability of our hardware?  Can we source a better poly lumber that will 
take our product longevity to an even higher level?  What new products can we add to our line? 
 
Our tag line is “Where life happens.”  We take that as a promise to our customers.  Life with family and friends is 
important.  Time in which meaningful relationships are built is crucial.  You can’t put a price tag on that.  That is 
why we give it our all, every day.  To make products where life happens; not just in a slogan – but in reality.
