Logging In To NetSuite 
NetSuite is a cloud-based ERP.  This means it lives in virtual space on the internet.  Each team member 
will have their own unique log in.  Although you can get to the NetSuite Log-In page you will only be able 
to log into NetSuite while on a company approved device due to current labor laws.  
Note:  You can only have one instance of NetSuite open for your log in credentials.  If you open a new 
browser window and log in again it will close your last session.
