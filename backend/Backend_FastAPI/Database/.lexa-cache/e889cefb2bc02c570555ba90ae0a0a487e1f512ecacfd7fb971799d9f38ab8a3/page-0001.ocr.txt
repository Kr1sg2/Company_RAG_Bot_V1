 
            
Thank you for recent purchase of a Trans-Ocean hand tufted area rug.  To preserve your new rugs beauty and 
longevity we recommend the proper care and maintenance techniques below.                                                                                 
  
Vacuum regularly with an upholstery attachment.  Please DO NOT USE a vacuum with a beater bar.  Sponge 
spots clean.  To clean the full rug, gently rinse with a solution of mild detergent and water.  Hose the rug clean 
and allow it to dry thoroughly.   
  
If long ends appear DO NOT pull.  This is not a defect, it is a normal occurrence in hand tufted rugs and is 
easily remedied using scissors to trim the sprouted section even with the rug.  (shown below)
