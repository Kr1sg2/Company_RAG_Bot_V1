Introduction 
At Windward Design Group, we understand that your outdoor living area is more than a place to sit, it’s an 
extension of your home, an extension of you. It is a place to relax, a place for celebrations, a place of romance and 
a place full of memories. Our goal is to assist you in getting the most out of your outdoor living area by furnishing 
that space with stylish, high quality products at a competitive price. We stand behind our products with pride and 
our warranty is confirmation of our confidence in the lasting quality of our products. With our broad line of 
collections, extensive outdoor fabric offering, beautiful frame finishes & unique embellishment options, it’s easy to 
customize our products to your individual style. 
Windward Design Group uses the highest quality materials available for outdoor furniture manufacturing.  All of 
our furniture is manufactured with commercial-grade, domestically milled, extruded aluminum. Many of 
Windward’s extrusions are proprietary and have internal reinforcing ribs to provide the additional strength 
expected when purchasing a quality, domestically manufactured piece of outdoor furniture. 
From stainless steel hardware that will never rust or corrode, to our custom fit nylon glides that are color 
coordinated with our frame finishes, our  attention to detail is reflected in each & every piece of furniture that we 
manufacture. Another detail we incorporate into our manufacturing process is full circumference, heliarc welds for 
added strength and durability. 
To ensure lasting color and quality, our frames are sandblasted to create an ideal bonding surface.  This 
sandblasting preparation ensures your powder coated finish will not peel, or chip. Once the frame has been 
prepared, a fine powder paint is oven-baked at temperatures reaching 400 degrees fahrenheit to ensure even, 
complete coverage. Our experienced staff works with only the most reputable powder suppliers to create the best 
quality mixture of powders to create consistent, beautiful outdoor frame finishes. 
Windward Design Group’s strap collections are designed with the ever demanding elements of nature in mind. We 
use 100% virgin, 2” vinyl and our strap pieces are doubled wrapped  around the frame and fastened with nylon 
solid shank rivets, creating a stronger hold with enhanced reliability. We offer almost four dozen strap colors, 
unlimited color combinations, and numerous customization options. In addition, many of our strap chaises include 
a safety feature to avoid finger pinching when adjusting the head rest position. We also offer many chaise seat 
heights... 14.5”, 16” & even 18”!  So, no matter the application... whether your customer requires furniture for 
their beach concession, backyard pool, or retirement community, we have a strap collection to suit their needs. 
Windward’s comfortable sling collections will enhance any outdoor setting. Sling combines versatile style with easy 
cleaning and maintenance, perfect for any atmosphere, residential or commercial. All of our sling pieces 
are double stitched for added strength and we offer numerous sling fabrics to choose from. In addition, our 
padded sling offers that step up in comfort with durable padding added to the seat and back. By adding a pad to 
your sling, the design possibilities really multiply! 
Windward Design Group’s outdoor cushions are designed to be more than just a pretty face, they are designed to 
handle the unexpected things that life brings. So sit back, relax and put your mind at ease knowing that our 
outdoor cushions surpass the highest quality and flammability standards issued for the furniture industry. Our 
deep seating collections & wicker replacement cushions are filled with our exclusive ComfortFLEX®  brand material, 
which provides an inviting, comfortable seat that won’t lose its loft. Our cushions are also completely 
customizable, with almost two hundred outdoor fabrics and many unique outdoor trim options to choose from, we 
are confident that our cushions will bring charm and allure to any outdoor setting. 
We are proud to say that our frame preparation, finish processes, finish materials and ComfortFLEX®  materials 
are environmentally friendly. 
We would be remiss if we didn’t mention one of our most valuable assets as a company and that is our 
people...our Windward Family!  We truly have one of the most outstanding group of dedicated, hard-working, 
knowledgeable, ever-improving, and dependable staff.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with not only
