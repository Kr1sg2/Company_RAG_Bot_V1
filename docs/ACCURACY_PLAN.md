# ACCURACY_PLAN.md

## Evaluation Goals

This document outlines the evaluation strategy for maintaining and improving the accuracy of the Company RAG Bot.

### Evaluation Objectives

- **Precision**: Ensure answers are factually correct based on source documents
- **Relevance**: Verify responses directly address user queries
- **Source Attribution**: Validate that sources are properly cited with correct page references
- **Coverage**: Assess if responses cover all relevant aspects of a query

### Datasets and Test Cases

- **Golden Standard Queries**: Curated set of company-specific questions with known correct answers
- **Edge Cases**: Queries that test boundary conditions (ambiguous questions, missing information)
- **Regression Tests**: Previously problematic queries that have been resolved

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Answer Relevance Score**: 1-5 scale rating of how well the answer addresses the query
- **Source Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly attributed source documents and page numbers
- **Response Time**: Average time to generate responses
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores from actual usage

### Regression Prevention

- **Automated Testing**: Run evaluation suite on every model or data update
- **Version Control**: Track changes to document corpus and model configurations
- **Performance Baselines**: Maintain minimum accuracy thresholds that must be met
- **Change Impact Analysis**: Assess how document updates affect existing query performance

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. Collect problematic queries from production usage
2. Add them to the regression test suite with expected answers
3. Iteratively improve chunking, retrieval, and generation parameters
4. Validate improvements don't break existing functionality
