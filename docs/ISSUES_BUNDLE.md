## Starter Development Issues

This document provides 10 starter issue ideas for improving the Company RAG Bot. These range from operational improvements to feature enhancements.

### 1. Working Hours Extractor Enhancement

**Title**: Implement working hours detection and context-aware responses

**Description**: 
Add functionality to detect when users ask about working hours, schedules, or time-sensitive information. Extract and highlight relevant time periods from documents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Detect queries about working hours, schedules, business hours
- Extract time ranges from document text
- Format time information consistently in responses
- Handle different time formats (12h/24h, timezones)

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days

### 2. Holiday Skip Logic

**Title**: Add holiday and special date awareness to responses

**Description**:
Implement logic to detect holiday schedules and exceptions in company policies. When users ask about dates that fall on holidays, provide appropriate context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Maintain calendar of company holidays
- Detect when queries involve holiday dates
- Provide holiday-aware responses for policy questions
- Support different holiday calendars (US, international offices)

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 3-4 days

### 3. Fast-path Response Knobs

**Title**: Implement configurable response speed vs accuracy trade-offs

**Description**:
Add configuration options to optimize for response speed vs thoroughness, allowing admins to tune the system for different use cases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Add response mode settings (fast, balanced, thorough)
- Configure chunk retrieval count per mode
- Adjust LLM parameters based on mode
- Provide admin UI for mode selection

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-5 days

### 4. Evaluation Harness

**Title**: Build automated evaluation system for RAG accuracy

**Description**:
Create a comprehensive testing framework to evaluate answer quality, source accuracy, and response consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Test suite with golden standard Q&A pairs
- Automated scoring for relevance and accuracy
- Source attribution validation
- Performance regression detection
- Reporting dashboard for evaluation results

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 5-7 days

---

### 5. Background Document Ingestion Job

**Title**: Implement asynchronous document processing pipeline

**Description**:
Add background job system for processing new documents without blocking the main application, including progress tracking and error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Queue system for document processing
- Progress tracking for ingestion jobs
- Error handling and retry logic
- Admin interface for job status monitoring
- Support for large document batches

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 4-6 days

---

### 6. Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Title**: Implement intelligent caching with automatic invalidation

**Description**:
Add caching layer for frequent queries and implement smart invalidation when documents are updated or system configuration changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cache frequent query responses
- Invalidate cache when documents change
- TTL-based cache expiration
- Cache hit rate monitoring
- Configuration for cache size and policies

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 3-4 days

---

### 7. Chunking Parameter Tuning Interface

**Title**: Add admin UI for chunking parameter optimization

**Description**:
Provide interface for administrators to experiment with different document chunking strategies and evaluate their impact on retrieval quality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- UI for adjusting chunk size and overlap
- Preview chunking results for sample documents
- A/B testing framework for chunking strategies
- Quality metrics for different chunking approaches
- Export/import chunking configurations

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 4-5 days

---

### 8. Retry and Circuit-breaker Policies

**Title**: Implement robust error handling for external service calls

**Description**:
Add resilient patterns for OpenAI API calls and other external dependencies to handle transient failures gracefully.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Circuit breaker for repeated failures
- Fallback responses when LLM unavailable
- Rate limiting compliance
- Error metrics and alerting

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### 9. Logging and Observability Improvements

**Title**: Enhanced logging, metrics, and tracing for production monitoring

**Description**:
Implement comprehensive observability to monitor system performance, user behavior, and identify improvement opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics for response times, error rates
- Query analytics and popular searches
- Performance tracing for slow requests
- Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Privacy-compliant query logging

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-4 days

---

### 10. Data Retention Policy Implementation

**Title**: Implement automated data lifecycle management

**Description**:
Add configurable policies for managing document versions, query logs, and system data retention to comply with privacy requirements and manage storage costs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Configurable retention periods for different data types
- Automated cleanup jobs for expired data
- Document version management
- Archive/restore functionality for old documents
- Compliance reporting for data retention
- Secure deletion procedures

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 4-6 days
